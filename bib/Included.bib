Design       This was a retrospective study, based on questionnaires assessing tinnitus and hyperacusis          and insomnia before and after CBT.              Study Sample       Data were gathered for 68 consecutive patients (average age = 52.5 years) who enrolled          for CBT.              Results       All measures showed significant improvements after CBT. Effect sizes for patients          who completed CBT were 1.13 for Tinnitus Handicap Inventory scores; 0.76 for Hyperacusis          Questionnaire scores; 0.71, 0.95, and 0.93 for tinnitus loudness, annoyance, and effect          on life, respectively, measured using the Visual Analog Scale; and 0.94 for the Insomnia          Severity Index score. An analysis including those who dropped out also showed significant          improvements for all measures.              Conclusion       Audiologist-delivered CBT led to significant improvements in self-report measures          of tinnitus and hyperacusis handicap and insomnia. The methods described here may          be used when designing future randomized controlled trials of efficacy.},

Pretherapy self-report scores, (BDI, BAI, BSI, IIP [see full names in text]) medication costs, disability costs and healthcare costs were compared with posttherapy values and normative values., RESULTS: Patients' mean self-report scores went from the abnormal to normal range after an average of 14.9 hours of therapy. Returns to work, reduced healthcare utilization, and medication stopping accounted for a cost reduction of over Cdn\$400,000 at one year after therapy., CONCLUSIONS: ISTDP appears to be an effective and cost-effective form of intervention when provided by a psychiatrist in a private office. Randomized controlled studies are warranted to further examine the cost benefits and efficacy of ISTDP.},

Trial therapies were interviews with active focus on emotions and how they are experienced. The interviews resulted in statistically significant improvements on all BSI subscales and one of the IIP subscales. One-third of clients required no further treatment, seven stopped medications, and two returned to work following trial therapy.

Intensive short-term dynamic psychotherapy (ISTDP) has been used to diagnose and manage somatization. We examined the effectiveness of this procedure for ED patients with MUS. Methods: We implemented a service that included staff education, timely access to consultation and gathering of outcome data. Results: Patients were assessed and treated shortly after referral. There was a mean reduction of 3.2 (69.0\%) ED visits per patient (standard deviation [SD] 6.4) the year afterward (95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.3\textendash 5.0, p {$<$} 0.001). In comparison revisit rates during the same time interval for 3 available ED populations (i.e., those matched by visit rates, those with matching complaints and all patients referred to the service but never seen) showed either smaller reductions or higher ED use (ranging from a 15\% reduction to a 43\% increase). Treatments averaged 3.8 sessions per patient (SD 5.3). Selfreported symptoms improved significantly with the Brief Symptom Inventory global rating, which changed from a mean of 1.21 (SD 0.58) before assessment to 0.86 (SD 0.63) (p {$<$} 0.01) at the end of contact with the service. The service appeared acceptable to both emergency physicians and patients. Conclusion: This emotion-focused assessment and treatment method appeared to be feasible and may be effective in reducing both symptoms and repeat ED use.},

  abstract = {Objectives: Cognitive behavioural therapy is commonly used to treat chronic fatigue syndrome and has been shown to be effective for reducing fatigue and improving physical functioning. Most of the evidence on the effectiveness of cognitive behavioural therapy for chronic fatigue syndrome is from randomised control trials, but there are only a few studies in naturalistic treatment settings. Our aim was to examine the effectiveness of cognitive behavioural therapy for chronic fatigue syndrome in a naturalistic setting and examine what factors, if any, predicted outcome. Design: Using linear mixed effects analysis, we analysed patients' self-reported symptomology over the course of treatment and at three-month follow-up. Furthermore, we explored what baseline factors were associated with improvement at follow-up. Setting: Data were available for 995 patients receiving cognitive behavioural therapy for chronic fatigue syndrome at an outpatient clinic in the UK. Participants: Participants were referred consecutively to a specialist unit for chronic fatigue or chronic fatigue syndrome. Main outcome measures: Patients were assessed throughout their treatment using self-report measures including the Chalder Fatigue Scale, 36-item Short Form Health Survey, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and Global Improvement and Satisfaction. Results: Patients' fatigue, physical functioning and social adjustment scores significantly improved over the duration of treatment with medium to large effect sizes (jdj {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.45\textendash 0.91). Furthermore, 85\% of patients self-reported that they felt an improvement in their fatigue at follow-up and 90\% were satisfied with their treatment. None of the regression models convincingly predicted improvement in outcomes with the best model being (R2 {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.137). Conclusions: Patients' fatigue, physical functioning and social adjustment all significantly improved following cognitive behavioural therapy for chronic fatigue syndrome in a naturalistic outpatient setting. These findings support the growing evidence from previous randomised control trials and suggest that cognitive behavioural therapy could be an effective treatment in routine treatment settings.},

  abstract = {Objective. To investigate the effectiveness of the Human Givens (HG) approach to the management of emotional distress in a primary care setting. To investigate whether or not the use of a shorter version (i.e., CORE-10) of a well-established psychometric instrument (i.e., Clinical Outcome in Routine Evaluation (CORE) CORE-outcome measure, CORE-OM) for sessional data collection is feasible for large-scale implementation of a practice research network (PRN). Design. All clients who chose to opt into assessment for treatment with three accredited HG therapists following referral for management of psychological distress, primarily anxiety and depression, by General Medical Practitioners (GPs) or GP practice nurses working in a primary care general medical practice over a 12-month period were included. Methods. The primary outcome measures were the CORE-OM and CORE-10. Pre-post effect sizes (Cohen's d) were calculated using pre, post, and pooled standard deviations to facilitate comparison with previously published studies. Mixed-design analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to look at differences in pre- and post-treatment symptoms and potential treatment effects based on type of termination and gender. Observed intent-to-treat pre-post effect size using the CORE-OM was also benchmarked against data from improving access to psychological therapies (IAPT) pilot site data. Results obtained using CORE-OM were compared with those obtained using CORE-10 to evaluate the feasibility of using the CORE-10 for routine use in real-world clinical settings. Results. Pre- to post-treatment changes measured with the CORE-OM and CORE-10 suggested that the therapy was highly effective, with clients remaining in treatment to completion demonstrating the greatest benefit. Reliable change and recovery rates comparisons between the CORE-OM and CORE-10 indicated that the CORE-10 is a viable alternative to the CORE-OM. Result of the benchmarking indicated that the observed pre-post effect size was clinically equivalent to IAPT data published by . Conclusions. Although replications are warranted as the current investigation is a pilot study, the HG approach appears to be an effective treatment. CORE-10 is a satisfactory generic sessional assessment to use in place of the 34-item CORE-OM. Use of a shorter yet reliable outcome measure is likely to increase assessment completion rates. PRNs appear to be a suitable mechanism to establish treatment effectiveness across a wide range of treatments in different settings.},

More research into the effectiveness of paraprofessionals with specific client populations is required to determine the conditions under which they can be most effective. Aims: To evaluate the effectiveness of a group of 12 minimally trained/experienced volunteer mental health counsellors. Method: Data were collected over a one year period on 118 clients referred to a voluntary sector counselling agency. The CORE-OM was used to measure clients' levels of distress on a session-by-session basis. Clients and counsellors also completed a range of additional self-report measures. A benchmarking strategy was used to evaluate the outcomes achieved by participants in this study against three benchmark studies selected from published literature. Results: Paraprofessionals in this study were less effective than their professional counterparts. Results showed that participants in this study achieved an effect size of .70 compared to effect sizes of 1.36, 1.39 and 1.42 in the selected benchmark studies. Implications: Findings suggest that minimally trained/experienced paraprofessional counsellors working in mental health settings may benefit from longer and more targeted training programmes before engaging in practice. Conclusions: The benchmarking strategy provided a valuable and practical means of evaluating the comparative effectiveness of paraprofessional and professional counsellors. Findings should be interpreted cautiously as the selected benchmarks are not precise measurements and may not reflect the organisational factors operating within voluntary sector counselling agencies.},

  abstract = {Background People with acquired brain injuries ( ABI) frequently experience psychological difficulties such as anxiety and depression, which may be underpinned and maintained by high self-criticism and shame alongside an inability to self-soothe. Compassionate focused therapy ( CFT) was developed to address shame and self-criticism and foster the ability to self-soothe. Objectives This is a naturalistic evaluation with the aim of assessing the feasibility, safety, and potential value of CFT for ABI patients with emotional difficulties receiving neuropsychological rehabilitation. Methods This study employed a mixed methods design combining self-report measures and qualitative interviews. Twelve patients received a combination of CFT group and individual intervention. Self-report measures of self-criticism, self-reassurance, and symptoms of anxiety and depression were collected pre and post programme and analysed using Wilcoxon signed rank test ( N = 12; five female, seven males). Follow-up data were analysed in the same manner ( N = 9). Interviews were conducted with six patients and analysed using interpretative phenomenological analysis. Results CFT was associated with significant reductions in measures of self-criticism, anxiety, and depression and an increase in the ability to reassure the self. No adverse effects were reported. Three superordinate themes emerged from the interviews: psychological difficulties; developing trust and finding safeness; and a new approach. Conclusions This study suggests that CFT is well accepted in ABI survivors within the context of neuropsychological rehabilitation. Furthermore, the results indicate that further research into CFT for psychological problems after ABI is needed and that there may be key aspects, which are specific to CFT intervention, which could reduce psychological difficulties after ABI. Practitioner points CFT appears to be a feasible intervention for psychological problems after ABI., CFT was associated with a reduction in symptoms of anxiety and depression and associated self-criticism, as well as enhanced self-reassurance for ABI survivors., These ABI survivors reported that CFT provided them with tools to manage continued psychological difficulties.},

Assessments were completed at baseline and end of treatment and included the Hospital Anxiety \& Depression Scale. Results in the form of a standardized effect of treatment were compared with five previous RCTs., RESULTS: The results from this clinical service indicated statistically significant outcomes with reductions in depression and anxiety. The uncontrolled effect size was large but inferior to those found in published RCTs., CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive behaviour therapy is effective for people with MS in routine clinical practice. Possible limits on effectiveness include more liberal patient selection, lack of specificity in rating scales and heterogeneity of target problems. Given the high rates of distress in this population, routine psychological interventions within neurology services are justifiable. Future research should aim to maximise CBT in such settings.

  abstract = {Objective: Patients with eating disorders (ED) often suffer from co-morbid depression, which may complicate the ED treatment. Previous studies have found that ED interventions seem to have limited capacity to reduce depressive symptoms. Several studies of interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT), have found that when patients have been treated for depression, co-morbid symptoms have diminished. As depression and EDs are commonly co-occurring conditions, this pilot study aimed to examine the effect of an IPT treatment for these conditions, with the focus on the depressive symptoms. Method: In this multi-centre study, 16 patients with EDs and co-occurring major depression received 16 weeks of depression-focused IPT. Results: Significant improvements with substantial effect sizes were found for both depression (d = 1.48) and ED (d = .93). Symptom reduction in the two syndromes were strongly correlated (r = .625, p = .004). Patients with a restrictive ED did not improve on either depression or ED symptoms. Conclusion: These findings point to the usefulness of IPT for concurrent depression and ED with a bingeing/purging symptomatology. Working with negative affect and problem-solving related to current interpersonal problems may alleviate general psychological distress among these patients.},

This study aims to assess the effectiveness of cognitive\textendash behavioural therapy applied by trainee therapists in patients with anxiety disorders seen in a private university service and to examine whether this effectiveness is comparable to that observed in controlled studies. Design. We compared the effectiveness of cognitive\textendash behavioural therapy at a private centre with that observed in meta-analyses and reviews of controlled studies. Methods. Out of the 96 initial patients with anxiety disorder, 64 completed the cognitive\textendash behavioural treatment and 59 also answered a series of questionnaires preand post-treatment. The effect size of the intervention was calculated, as were the percentages of patients who improved and those who recovered. Results. The pre-post effect size (1.09) was large, although somewhat lower than those observed in a meta-analysis of Spanish studies and in a range of international meta-analyses; moreover, twice as many hours of treatment were administered (M {$\frac{1}{4}$} 27:4) and the drop-out rate was higher (33.3\%). The percentages of patients who improved (61\%) and those who recovered (52.5\%) were roughly comparable to those reported in various reviews of studies performed in anxiety disorders. Conclusions. Cognitive\textendash behavioural therapy applied by trainee therapists in a private university service appears effective, although this efficacy may be somewhat lower than that in controlled studies. Moreover, the duration of treatment and the drop-out rate may be higher.},

  abstract = {Objective: Contemporary research demonstrates the feasibility of assessing therapeutic performance of trainee-therapists through the use of objective measures of client treatment outcome. Further, significant variation between individual therapists based on their client treatment outcomes has been demonstrated. This study sets out to determine whether a reliable composite measure of therapeutic efficiency, effectiveness and early dropout can be developed and used to objectively compare trainee-therapists against each other. Design and methods: Treatment outcomes of 611 clients receiving treatment from 58 trainee-therapists enrolled in a professional training programme were tracked with the OQ-45.2 over a 6-year period to assess therapeutic efficiency, therapeutic effectiveness and early client dropout. Results: Significant variation between trainee-therapists was observed for each index. Findings of a moderately strong correlation between therapeutic efficiency and effectiveness enabled the ranking of trainee-therapists based upon a composite measure of these indexes. A non-significant correlation was found between early client dropout and measures of therapeutic effectiveness and efficiency. Conclusions: The findings stress the importance of utilizing objective measures to track the treatment outcomes. Despite all trainee-therapists being enrolled in the same training programme, significant variation between trainee-therapists' therapeutic efficiency and effectiveness was found to exist. Practitioner points Developing of potential benchmarking tools that enable trainee-therapists, supervisors and educational institutions to quickly assess therapeutic performance can become part of a holistic assessment of a trainee-therapist's clinical development. Despite an inherent optimistic belief that therapists do not cause harm, there appears to be a small and significant proportion of trainee-therapists who consistently evidence little therapeutic change. Considerable variability in trainee-therapists' therapeutic efficiency and effectiveness can exist in the one training programme. Early client dropout may not be associated with therapists' therapeutic effectiveness and efficiency. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Both the definition of who was treated and the index chosen to represent outcome can affect estimates dramatically. Design. We used data from the Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation (CORE) Primary Care National Practice-Based Evidence database-2005 on the Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation-Outcome Measure (CORE-OM) from 33,587 patients and examined rates of improvement in psychological therapies in UK National Health Service (NHS) primary care services using various definitions of effectiveness. Methods. We constructed successively more restrictive sub-samples of patients, including practice-based analogues of several types of intent-to-treat (ITT) groups and completer groups. We focussed on patients scoring above clinical cut-off at intake, but we also considered samples that included sub-clinical patients. We assessed two types of recovery rates, improvement rates, mean pre-post change, and pre-post effect sizes for each sub-sample. Results. There was wide variation in the overall effectiveness of treatments as a function of which subset of data was considered and which specific criterion of recovery rate was adopted. Recovery rates and pre-post effect sizes ranged from 19\% to 65\% and 0.60 to 1.95, respectively. Conclusions. Because estimates of effectiveness could have significant policy implications, clarity on the meanings of the differing constructions is essential.},

Methods: A non-randomised comparison of clinical outcomes in N = 90 patients with BPD receiving either DBT or MBT over a 12-month period. Results: After adjusting for potentially confounding differences between participants, participants receiving DBT reported a significantly steeper decline over time in incidents of self-harm (adjusted IRR = 0.93, 95\% CI 0.87-0.99, p = 0.02) and in emotional dysregulation (adjusted beta = -1.94, 95\% CI -3.37 to -0.51, p {$<$} 0.01) than participants receiving MBT. Differences in treatment dropout and use of crisis services were no longer significant after adjusting for confounding, and there were no significant differences in BPD symptoms or interpersonal problems. Conclusions: Within this sample of people using specialist personality disorder treatment services, reductions in self-harm and improvements in emotional regulation at 12 months were greater amongst those receiving DBT than amongst those receiving MBT. Experimental studies assessing outcomes beyond 12 months are needed to examine whether these findings represent differences in the clinical effectiveness of these therapies.

Despite its growing popularity, to date, no studies have examined the application of CAT for chronic pain. Aims: The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of time-limited, individual CAT for adults with chronic pain as delivered in a publicly funded Community Pain Management Service. Methods: This was an observational service evaluation of treatment practice within a routine clinical setting. Participants were 53 adults with chronic pain who completed eight sessions of individual therapy. Individual and group-level outcomes on self-reported distress, pain-related self-efficacy, as well as changes in healthcare utilisation pre- and post-intervention were examined. Results: Large pre\textendash post effects on wellbeing (d\,=\,1.50) and self-efficacy (d\,=\,1.13) were observed, while effects on healthcare utilisation were medium to large (d\,=\,0.67). Moreover, reliable change and clinical significance analyses demonstrated that results were clinically meaningful. The majority of clients (67.9\%) showed reliable improvement following the CAT intervention and 28\% achieved both reliable and clinically significant improvements in psychological distress. Approximately 4 of 10 clients (43.5\%) showed reliably higher perceived self-efficacy at the end of therapy. Conclusion: The results of this evaluation suggest that brief CAT is an encouraging intervention for adults with persistent pain. While preliminary, our findings provide support for a brief approach to persistent pain that focuses not on controlling or eliminating pain but on elucidating and revising unhelpful relational patterns that may impinge upon one's pain management. Directions for future research are suggested.},

Data were analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA. Effect sizes were also computed. Results The results show statistically significant reductions in recipients' levels of psychological distress and interpersonal problems and an increase in self-esteem. Effect sizes were modest to large. Conclusions The study shows that adults with intellectual disabilities can benefit from individual psychotherapy provided in routine clinical practice. The method has obvious limitations because of its uncontrolled, open trial design. However, the study had a recipient group that represents the client population and thus has greater generalisability to clinical practice. This study also provides some suggestions for routine audit and evaluation exercises and more rigorous designs.},

The sample included 951 individuals with either major depressive disorder (n = 857) or bipolar disorder with depressed mood (n = 94). Participants completed a battery of self-report measures assessing depression, overall well-being, and a range of secondary outcomes both before and after treatment. We found significant reductions in depressive symptoms, worry, self-harm, emotional lability, and substance abuse, as well as significant improvements in well-being and interpersonal relationships, post-treatment. Comparable to outpatient studies, 30\% of the sample evidenced recovery from depression. Comparison of findings to benchmark studies indicated that, although the current sample started treatment with severe depressive symptoms and were in treatment for average of only 10 days, the overall magnitude of symptom improvement was similar to that of randomized controlled trials. Limitations of the study include a lack of control group, a limitation of most naturalistic studies. These findings indicate that interventions developed in controlled research settings on the efficacy of CBT can be transported to naturalistic, "real world" settings, and that brief CBT delivered in a partial hospital program is effective for many patients with severe depressive symptoms.

  abstract = {Objective: To investigate the effectiveness of psychological therapy in reducing psychological distress for adults with autism spectrum conditions (ASC) and co-morbid mental health conditions in routine clinical practice. To explore the effect of individual characteristics and service factors on change in general distress. Method: In a specialist psychological therapies service for adults with ASC, the Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation-Outcome Measure (CORE-OM) self-report questionnaire of psychological distress is completed by clients at start and end of therapy. Change over time and reliable and clinical change was assessed for 81 of a total of 122 clients (66.4\%). Factors which may influence change over time were explored using available clinical information. Results: Overall, there was a significant reduction in CORE-OM score during therapy with a small effect size. Most clients showed an improvement in psychological distress over therapy (75.4\% improved, with 36.9\% of these showing reliable changes). Significant and comparable reductions from pre-therapy to post-therapy were seen across the sample, showing that individual differences did not mediate therapy effectiveness. CORE-OM scores mediate the association between age of ASD diagnosis and hours of therapeutic input required, with greater age at diagnosis and higher distress associated with longer therapy duration. Conclusions: Our preliminary findings suggest that psychological therapy may be effective in reducing general distress for clients with ASC and co-morbid mental health conditions and should be routinely offered. Individuals who are diagnosed with ASD in adulthood are likely to require a longer course of therapy when their general distress scores are high.},

  abstract = {Until this study, there were no national data for the effectiveness of counselling or psychotherapy provided in the primary care context in the Republic of Ireland. The government policy document Vision for Change states that 35\% of all primary healthcare service users attend their GP with a mental health element to their overall presentation (The Stationery Office, 2006). The HSE?s nationally available Counselling in Primary Care (CIPC) service was fully implemented in July 2013 in order to address excessive waiting times for access to psychology services for people experiencing mild to moderate mental difficulties. Clinical evaluations are crucial for providing evidence for the effectiveness of counselling in primary care settings. The aim of this study was to provide the international research community, mental health policy makers and other stakeholders with effectiveness benchmarks regarding the behaviour of variables shown by previous research to be influential in outcomes of counselling and psychotherapy. This study involved a very large sample of CIPC clients (N = 2,781) attending therapy at locations spread across the Republic of Ireland. In order to improve counselling services for users it is beneficial to know the relationships between particular therapeutic characteristics in a real-world setting and outcomes for service users, e.g. severity of initial distress, gender differences etc. Further, while the efficacy of psychological treatments is established in randomised clinical trials it is vital that funding bodies can comprehend how investment in efficacy is converted into effectiveness in routine conditions. Evaluations have been conducted in the United Kingdom Australia and the United States and contribute greatly to understanding the role of primary care counselling and psychological interventions. As well as assessing the overall effectiveness of the CIPC service using pre/post analyses and calculating effect sizes, the study also examined the effect of the duration of therapy on client outcomes using logistic regression to determine the likelihood of clients achieving reliable and clinically significant improvement (RCSI).The role of the initial severity of clients problems was also examined (as determined by counsellor/therapists? evaluation as well as an objective measure as determined by CORE OM scores) in terms of its effect on outcomes. Regarding the longer term effect of counselling, additional data were provided by 240 study participants six months after therapy ended which as analysed by way of multi-level modelling. The model indicated a significant effect of time on CORE OM scores, which were also predicted by the initial severity of clients? problems and the overall duration of therapy at statistically significant level. There were no differences in outcomes for clients receiving a single therapy approach and those receiving more than one approach and no one of the approaches performed better than others in terms of statistical significance.  The study also examined outcomes from the Health Related Quality of Life questionnaire (HRQOL). This measure is used extensively in the United States by the Centre for Disease Control (CDC) as both an outcome measure and population health tracker. Its brevity (four items) and framing of three of the four items as a number of days in the previous 30 when respondents physical and mental health was not good, and the days their activity was limited has been widely accepted as a reliable and valid measure of HRQOL. This study found a good level of congruence between the HRQOL and the CORE OM. Participants in the study showed significant levels of improvement across all items with significant reductions in the number of unhealthy days reported between pre and post therapy and improvement in their perception of their general health.},

The present study examined the relationship between pretreatment patient symptomatology and patient attitudes toward the audio or video recording of psychotherapy sessions. Treatment refusal, duration, and outcome were also examined as they related to patient comfort with recording. A total of 390 participants completed an initial intake in a universitybased community outpatient clinic. Pretreatment patient symptomatology was measured at the initial intake evaluation using the Brief Symptom Inventory (Derogatis, 1993), and patient attitudes toward audio or video recording were measured using an audio/videotape comfort form. The majority of patients expressed no or slight concerns (52\%), and almost three quarters (71\%) were willing to consider audio or video recording. It was found that higher levels of pretreatment interpersonal sensitivity and paranoia have a significant negative relationship to recording comfort (i.e., greater pathology related to lower comfort). However, treatment refusal, duration, and outcome were not significantly related to patient comfort with recording. Significant intake clinician effects were observed in regard to patient-rated comfort regarding audio or video recordings, indicating a relationship between patients' intake clinician and their level of comfort. Therapist effects were examined with regard to treatment refusal, duration, and outcome, and all results remained nonsignificant. This research has implications for and supports the implementation of audio- or video-recording practices in clinical training, research, and practice.},

DESIGN AND METHOD: Clients (N = 58) contracted to attend between 12 and 20 sessions of CT completed the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) immediately prior to each therapy session. The BDI and other measures were collected at intake and, for those who completed therapy, at a post-therapy assessment. RESULTS: Completers' BDI scores improved significantly from intake to post-treatment and significantly more from intake to their final session than did those of non-completers. However, when non-completers' final session scores were matched with scores of randomly selected completers at the corresponding session, the difference in improvement was not significant.

This residual sleep impairment, as well as the presence of problem levels of certain sleep beliefs, may be important for depressive relapse prevention, and as such should be addressed in treatment. The following study examined residual sleep disturbance and residual maladaptive sleep beliefs in those treated with Cognitive Behavior Therapy for depression. Methods: Participants (N = 24) were clinic patients seeking treatment for depression at a community clinic. Repeated measures analyses of variance tested pre- to posttreatment change on depression symptoms, general negative beliefs, sleep quality, and maladaptive sleep beliefs. Results: As expected, significant time effects were found for depressive symptoms and general negative beliefs. Sleep quality scores also decreased significantly at posttreatment; however, 92\% of those no longer meeting depressive criteria continued to endorse residual sleep disturbance, according to an established clinical cutoff score of {$>$}5 on a validated measure of sleep quality (the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index). There were no significant pre- to posttreatment changes for maladaptive sleep beliefs. Conclusions: The results indicate that sleep disturbance and maladaptive sleep-related beliefs remain a problematic residual symptom of remitted depression. These findings are discussed with reference to improving cognitive behavioral treatments for depression in order to help reduce rates of residual sleep problems.

An additional benefit associated with the use of patient-focused research systems is the facilitating the integration of clinical and research endeavors. In an archival study, the current work utilized patient-focused research data (N = 132) to explore outcomes. Analyses focused on the number of sessions required for clients to experience reliable improvement or clinically significant change, while controlling for relevant pretreatment characteristics. Results demonstrated that while a significant proportion of clients experienced positive effect from treatment (41.2\%), an even larger proportion of the sample (48.9\%) did not experience any reliable improvement. In addition, results demonstrated that the number of presenting problems significantly influenced the median treatment length for improvement, with more than 1 problem generally predicting faster improvement. Finally, the results also highlighted potential problems with treatment length, with a number of clients staying in treatment significantly longer than what would be predicted to generate reliable or clinically significant change. Overall, the results support conducting psychotherapy research in a training clinic environment, with the potential for research to inform clinical care as well as clinical care informing future research projects.

Results suggest that time-limited therapy has a positive impact on the mental health needs of clients referred to a CMHT by GPs. It is concluded that it is appropriate to justify the use of time-limited therapy in a CMHT-based setting. Suggestions for further research are made.},

  abstract = {Despite the heterogeneous nature of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), many selfreport assessments do not adequately capture the clinical picture presenting within each symptom dimension, particularly unacceptable thoughts (UTs). In addition, obsessions and ordering/arranging compulsions are often underrepresented in samples of treatment outcome studies for OCD. Such methodological discrepancies may obscure research findings comparing treatment outcomes across OCD symptom dimensions. This study aimed to improve upon previous research by investigating treatment outcomes across OCD symptom dimensions using the Dimensional Obsessive-Compulsive Scale, which offers a more comprehensive assessment of UTs. The study included a primarily residential sample of 134 OCD patients. Results indicated that there were no significant differences in treatment outcomes across symptom dimensions. However, the severity of UTs remained significantly greater than other symptom dimensions at both admission and discharge. Thus, it is possible that UTs may exhibit uniquely impairing features, compared with other symptom dimensions. It is also possible that these findings may reflect the characteristics of the residential OCD samples. These speculations as well as implications for OCD treatment and future research are discussed. Key words: obsessive-compulsive disorder; symptom dimensions; unacceptable thoughts; treatment outcomes.},

A decrease in headache intensity, frequency, headache-specific impairment, depression, and change of pain-related cognitions was expected. Background The efficacy of CBT for primary headaches has been confirmed in research, yet the translation into clinical practice has remained untested thus far. Design In this single-group outcome study, 87 headache patients diagnosed with migraine and/or tension-type headache received (1) headache-specific medication for 10 weeks and (2) a subsequent CBT treatment made up of 13 individual and 12 group sessions consisting of psychoeducation, progressive muscle relaxation, coping strategies for pain and stress, and goal setting skills. Booster group sessions after 3 and 6 months were implemented to stimulate individual goal attainment, and follow-up measures were recorded up to 12 months. Results A significant decrease was found for all primary and secondary outcome criteria, ie, average headache intensity (prae M: 6.0, standard deviation [ SD]: 1.5 vs follow-up [ FU] 1 year M: 5.1, SD: 1.9), headache frequency (prae M: 16.0, SD: 9.5 vs FU 1 year M: 13.4, SD: 9.9), and catastrophizing (prae M: 3.4, SD: 1.0 vs FU 1 year M: 2.6, SD: 1.1). Coping strategies were increased (prae M: 3.4, SD: .9 vs FU 1 year M: 4.0, SD: 1.0). Conclusion CBT treatment is a useful component within a routine clinical setting and can improve standard medical care thereby helping patients in managing their headache pain.},

In many cases, there are unresolved psychological and emotional processes underlying these symptoms, leaving traditional medical approaches insufficient. This paper details a collaborative exploration of the the implementation of an evidence-based, emotion-focused psychotherapy service for MUS across two community-based academic family medicine teaching clinics. The theory and evidence-base for using Intensive Short-Term Dynamic Psychotherapy (ISTDP) with MUS is presented along with the key service components of assessment, treatment, education and research. Preliminary outcome indicators showed diverse benefits. Patients reported significantly decreased somatic symptoms in the Patient Health Questionnaire-15 (d = 0.4). A statistically significant (23\%) decrease in family physicians' visits was found in the 6 months after attending the MUS service compared to the 6 months prior. Both patients and primary care clinicians reported a high degree of satisfaction with the service. Whilst further research is needed, these findings suggest that a direct psychology service maintained within the family practice clinic may assist patient and clinician function while reducing healthcare utilization. Challenges and further service developments are discussed, including the potential benefits of re-branding the service to become a `Primary Care Psychological Consultation and Treatment Service'.},

During inpatient treatment, narcissistic aspects decreased, and mood and quality of life increased. Changes in threatened self were associated with an improvement on all mood dimensions.

The purpose of this non-randomized study was to evaluate the usefulness of a trauma-focused treatment approach for travel phobia, or milder travel anxiety arising as a result of a road traffic accident. Trauma-focused Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (TF-CBT), and Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing were used to treat a sample of 184 patients, who were referred to a psychological rehabilitation provider. Patients in both treatment groups were encouraged to encounter their feared objects and situations between sessions. Specific (i.e., travel) phobia was diagnosed in 57\% of cases. Patients in both treatment conditions showed equally large, and clinically significant, decreases in symptoms as indexed by three validated measures (Impact of Event Scale, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and General Health Questionnaire), therapist ratings of treatment outcome, and a return to driving or travelling by car or motorbike. These improvements were obtained within an average course of 7.3 sessions of 1 hour each. Patients with travel phobia responded with a greater reduction of anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms than those with milder travel anxiety. Passengers reported higher levels of trauma symptoms than drivers, but no difference in effectiveness of treatment was found between these groups. The results suggest that trauma-focused psychological interventions can be a treatment alternative for patients with travel anxiety. Given the seriousness of the clinical problems related to road traffic accidents more rigorous outcome research is warranted and needed.

Several psychological interventions are available, but there is a lack of evidence to decide which treatment works best for whom. This study aimed to identify subgroups of patients who respond differentially to cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or person-centered counseling for depression (CfD)., METHOD: This was a retrospective analysis of archival routine practice data for 1,435 patients who received either CBT (N = 1,104) or CfD (N = 331) in primary care. The main outcome was posttreatment reliable and clinically significant improvement (RCSI) in the PHQ-9 depression measure. A targeted prescription algorithm was developed in a training sample (N = 1,085) using a supervised machine learning approach (elastic net with optimal scaling). The clinical utility of the algorithm was examined in a statistically independent test sample (N = 350) using chi-square analysis and odds ratios., RESULTS: Cases in the test sample that received their model-indicated "optimal" treatment had a significantly higher RCSI rate (62.5\%) compared to those who received the "suboptimal" treatment (41.7\%); chi2(df = 1) = 4.79, p = .03, OR = 2.33 (95\% CI [1.09, 5.02])., CONCLUSION: Targeted prescription has the potential to make best use of currently available evidence-based treatments, improving outcomes for patients at no additional cost to psychological services.

This study investigated whether Cognitive Therapy for PTSD (CT-PTSD) can be effectively implemented into a UK National Health Service Outpatient Clinic serving a defined ethnically mixed urban catchment area. Method: A consecutive sample of 330 patients with PTSD (age 17e83) following a wide range of traumas were treated by 34 therapists, who received training and supervision in CT-PTSD. Pre and post treatment data (PTSD symptoms, anxiety, depression) were collected for all patients, including dropouts. Hierarchical linear modeling investigated candidate moderators of outcome and therapist effects. Results: CT-PTSD was well tolerated and led to very large improvement in PTSD symptoms, depression and anxiety. The majority of patients showed reliable improvement/clinically significant change: intentto-treat: 78.8\%/57.3\%; completer: 84.5\%/65.1\%. Dropouts and unreliable attenders had worse outcome. Statistically reliable symptom exacerbation with treatment was observed in only 1.2\% of patients. Treatment gains were maintained during follow-up (M {$\frac{1}{4}$} 280 days, n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 220). Few of the selection criteria used in some RCTs, demographic, diagnostic and trauma characteristics moderated treatment outcome, and only social problems and needing treatment for multiple traumas showed unique moderation effects. There were no random effects of therapist on symptom improvement, but therapists who were inexperienced in CT-PTSD had more dropouts than those with greater experience. Conclusions: The results support the effectiveness of CT-PTSD and suggest that trauma-focused cognitive behavior therapy can be successfully implemented in routine clinical services treating patients with a wide range of traumas.},

  abstract = {Objectives. This study explores whether improvements, as measured by the COREOM/10, as a result of psychological therapy were related to length of treatment in weeks, number of treatment sessions, or treatment intensity, as well as any effect of diagnostic group. Methods and Design. Pre- and post-therapy CORE-OM/10 scores were extracted from the clinical records of all secondary care adult psychological therapy team patients who undertook psychological therapy between 2010 and 2013 in one mental health trust. Of the 4,877 patients identified, 925 had complete records. Length of therapy was divided by the number of sessions to create `treatment intensity' (sessions per week). Nonparametric analyses were used, initial score was controlled for, and diagnostic group was explored. Results. No relationship was found between change in score and the number of sessions, therapy length, or treatment intensity; however, change in score was positively correlated with first-session score. Patients with higher initial scores had longer therapies; however, treatment intensity was similar for patients with lower pre-therapy distress. There were differences in treatment length (weeks) between diagnostic groups. Demographic differences were found between patients with and without complete records, prompting caution in terms of generalizability. Conclusions. These findings are consistent with the responsive regulation model (Barkham et al., 1996) which proposes that patients vary in their response to treatment, resulting in no associations between session numbers or treatment intensity and therapeutic gain with aggregated scores. Patients with higher CORE scores at the outset of psychological therapy had longer not more intensive therapy. There was variation in treatment intensity between diagnostic clusters.},

  abstract = {Background: This study investigated distinct trajectories of treatment response in a naturalistic intensive/residential treatment (IRT) program for adults with severe obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). We hypothesized that: (1) distinct trajectories would emerge and (2) demographic variables, psychiatric comorbidity, OCD symptom subtype, level of insight, previous exposure and response prevention (ERP) treatment, and quality of life, would differentially predict assignment to these trajectories.Methods: Participants included 305 individuals with primary OCD admitted for IRT.Results: Two trajectories emerged over the course of the first eight weeks of treatment, with the vast majority of participants demonstrating treatment response. The first trajectory (96\%, n = 292) showed a negative, linear treatment response (a.k.a. "linear responders") and more severe OCD symptoms at admission. The second trajectory (4\%, n = 13) had less severe OCD symptoms at admission and did not exhibit a significant overall change in symptoms over the course of treatment. More specifically, this second trajectory or "u-shaped responders" show a non-significant linear response through week four of treatment, followed by slightly increased symptoms in week five. Assignment to these classes was not differentially predicted by hypothesized predictor variables.Limitations: Our final model had inconsistent fit indices and small class prevalance of the u-shaped responder group; therefore, model selection was based on both fit indices and substantive meaning.Conclusions: This study emprically derived two distinct trajectories of OCD symptom severity over the course of IRT. These findings have the potential to refine IRT for patients with severe OCD, and to potentially guide future investigation into the optimal delivery of ERP treatment for OCD generally.},

Method : This study investigated two naturalistic samples of depressed patients regarding treatment outcome as well as clinical and treatment characteristics. Patients were treated in a psychoanalytical psychosomatic hospital unit. Data was collected from 2000 to 2002 (N=234) and from 2008 to 2010 (N=514). Data was acquired at admission and discharge. Results: The findings reveal high pre-post effect sizes for symptom reduction (SCL-90-R), general functioning (GAF) and medium changes of interpersonal problems (IIP). The improvement on the IIP was significantly higher for patients with comorbid personality disorder. Based on therapist ratings, the sample treated from 2008-2010 showed higher levels of impairment on several levels: chronic, complex, functional (GAF) and structural (OPD). Conclusion: Findings indicate that patients show substantial short-term benefit following psychoanalytic inpatient psychotherapy, as practiced under naturalistic conditions. Open questions remain regarding the long-term nature of these benefits and the possible influence of placebo-effects.},

Adapted cognitive behavior therapy for obsessive-compulsive disorder in adults with autism spectrum disorder has not previously been evaluated outside the United Kingdom. In this study, 19 adults with obsessive-compulsive disorder and autism spectrum disorder were treated using an adapted cognitive behavior therapy protocol that consisted of 20 sessions focused on exposure with response prevention. The primary outcome was the clinician-rated Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale. Participants were assessed up to 3\,months after treatment. There were significant reductions on the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale at post-treatment (d\,=\,1.5), and improvements were sustained at follow-up (d\,=\,1.2). Self-rated obsessive-compulsive disorder and depressive symptoms showed statistically significant reductions. Improvements in general functioning and quality of life were statistically non-significant. Three participants (16\%) were responders at post-treatment and four (21\%) were in remission from obsessive-compulsive disorder. At follow-up, three participants (16\%) were responders and one (5\%) was in full remission. Adapted cognitive behavior therapy for obsessive-compulsive disorder in adults with co-occurring autism spectrum disorder is associated with reductions in obsessive-compulsive symptoms and depressive symptoms. However, outcomes are modest; few patients were completely symptom free, and treatment engagement was low with few completed exposures and low adherence to homework assignments. We identify and discuss the need for further treatment refinement for this vulnerable group.},

Research into the effectiveness of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) in primary care has produced positive results.Aim: The aim of this study was to compare a hospital-based and a primary care-based CBT service, to investigate if the setting of treatment affected participants' rate of recovery and levels of satisfaction.Method: 52 participants who received CBT treatment for a range of psychological problems in either setting were compared using a non-randomized, quasi-experimental, design. A range of psychological measures were taken at baseline and over the first six treatment sessions, and rate of change in psychological symptoms and satisfaction were compared.Results: Both groups demonstrated improvement over the period of the study but the participants from the primary care group showed a more rapid rate of recovery during the first six sessions, and received briefer treatment. Such differential rates of treatment change were not attributable to group differences in terms of chronicity or severity. The primary care group also reported significantly higher levels of satisfaction.Conclusions: The setting of treatment might impact on patients' outcome, with primary care patients responding more rapidly than those seen in secondary care. Providing a service in primary care might also increase patient compliance with treatment.

To date, there is no empirical support for these assertions.Aims: The current study examined the assumption of iatrogenic effects among BPD adults.Methods: Clinically significant and reliable change in symptoms, functional capacities, and adverse events were quantified for both inpatients with BPD (n = 245) and a well-matched inpatient reference (n = 220) sample. Latent growth curve (LGC) models were used to evaluate moderators of the trajectory of PHQ-9 depression scores over the course of hospitalization.Results: Large effect size improvements were observed in depression, anxiety, suicidal ideation and functional disability among patients with BPD (Cohen's d {$\geq$} 1.0) and those in the reference sample (Cohen's d {$\geq$} .80). Clinical deterioration and adverse events were rare (occurring in no more than 1.1\% of BPD and reference patients on any outcome) with no difference across patient cohorts. BPD diagnosis failed to influence the trajectory of continuous depression severity. Rather, trait emotion dysregulation was associated with initial depression severity.Conclusions: Twenty-five years ago it was assumed that adults with BPD could not benefit from psychiatric treatment. Today there are a number of effective evidence-based outpatient treatments for BPD, but beliefs about extended inpatient treatment have changed little. Current results indicate that extended inpatient treatment can result in significant and clinically meaningful symptomatic and functional improvement in BPD patients without iatrogenic effects.},

Aims: To evaluate clinical outcomes during and after a 1-year period of admission within a low secure unit for women offering a Dialectical Behaviour Therapy programme. Method: A naturalistic, within subjects study of clinical data collected as part of routine practice was conducted. Participants were 18 consecutively admitted women who met the diagnostic criteria for Borderline Personality Disorder and had completed at least 1 year of treatment. Measures covered: risk behaviours; self-reported symptoms of Borderline Personality Disorder, and current mood and symptom experience; staff reports of clinical problems, needs and social functioning. Scores were compared between admission and at 6 months and 1 year. Results: There was a statistically significant improvement on all 13 measures over the year's treatment. Most improvement was demonstrated between admission and 6 months. Conclusions: Engagement in 1-year's treatment was associated with significant reduction in risk behaviours and both staff-rated and self-rated outcome measures. Some significant questions remain about which elements of the programme are most effective but the results are encouraging. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Methods: Fourteen female patients with concurrent diagnoses of alcohol dependence and major depression participated. Assessments were conducted at baseline, midtreatment (8 and 16 weeks), posttreatment (24 weeks), and follow-up (32 weeks). Results: Participants attended a mode of 8 out of 8 possible sessions of IPT in addition to their routine addiction care, and reported high treatment satisfaction on the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire-8. Women's drinking behavior, depressive symptoms, and interpersonal functioning improved significantly over the treatment period and were sustained at follow-up. Conclusions: These preliminary findings suggest that IPT is a feasible, highly acceptable adjunctive behavioral intervention for AD-MD women.},

All treatment groups reported PTSD symptom improvement with no significant differences based on therapy type. For depression, the rate of improvement for clients in PCT who dropped out of treatment after session 3 was significantly steeper than the rate of improvement for clients in eclectic treatment who dropped out of treatment after session 3. Clients who stayed in treatment longer generally had larger decreases in symptoms compared to those who dropped out earlier.Limitations: The small sample size in each of the treatment groups may have limited power to detect change.Conclusions: Several trauma-focused treatments offered in a community-based setting may result in significant symptomatic improvement.},

In this evaluation of a primary care counselling service offering person-centred counselling, the Core Outcome Measure (CORE-OM) was administered at referral and at the beginning and end of therapy. A pre-post therapy effect size for 697 individuals over a 5 year period was 1.2. This compares with a waitlist (between referral and pre therapy) effect size of 0.24 for 382 individuals over a three year period. The results indicate that person-centred counselling is effective for clients with common mental health problems, such as anxiety and depression. Effectiveness is not limited to individuals with mild to moderate symptoms of recent onset, but extends to people with moderate to severe symptoms of longer duration.},

  abstract = {Background: Cognitive therapy (CT) has been shown to be efficacious in the treatment of depression in numerous randomized controlled trials (RCTs). However, little evidence is available that speaks to the effectiveness of this treatment under routine clinical conditions. Method: This paper examines outcomes of depressed individuals seeking cognitive therapy at an outpatient clinic (N = 217, Center for Cognitive Therapy; CCT). Outcomes were then compared to those of participants in a large NIMH-funded RCT of cognitive therapy and medications as treatments for depression. Results: The CCT is shown to be a clinically representative setting, and 61\% of participants experienced reliable change in symptoms over the course of treatment; of those, 45\% (36\% of the total sample) met criteria for recovery by the end of treatment. Participants at CCT had similar outcomes to participants treated in the RCT, but there was some evidence that those with more severe symptoms at intake demonstrated greater improvement in the RCT than their counterparts at CCT. Limitations: The CCT may not be representative of all outpatient settings, and the structure of treatment there was considerably different from that in the RCT. Treatment fidelity was not assessed at CCT. Conclusions: Depressed individuals treated with cognitive therapy in a routine clinical care setting showed a significant improvement in symptoms. When compared with outcomes evidenced in RCTs, there was little evidence of superior outcomes in either setting. However, for more severe participants, outcomes were found to be superior when treatment was delivered within an RCT than in an outpatient setting. Clinicians treating such patients in nonresearch settings may thus benefit from making modifications to treatment protocols to more closely resemble research settings.

Our aims were to (1) profile patients and their presenting problems accessing a new Primary Care Mental Health (PCMH) service; (2) evaluate the effectiveness of the PCMH service in terms of patient outcomes; and (3) compare service parameters with those derived from national primary care counselling. The PCMH service was delivered in 54 general practitioner (GP) practices and provided mental health assessment, brief psychological interventions (usually up to six sessions), and onward referral to specialist services where required. Data were routinely collected over a 34-month period regarding (1) access to the PCMH service (number of patients referred, demographics, non-attendance rates, assessment outcome and completion of treatment) and (2) patient outcome using the Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation-Outcome Measure (CORE). Outcome data were compared with a national dataset from 33 primary care counselling services. In total 6750 patients were referred to the PCMH service and 5539 had been discharged by the end of the evaluation. The non-attendance rate for assessment was 26.1\%. One in five patients referred to the service completed therapy sessions. Outcomes of treatment were comparable with primary care counselling data. Patients choosing to complete treatment after three sessions achieved the greatest gains on average. Attrition is a key problem for efficient mental health service delivery in primary care. Evaluating this new service against national comparators of more established service delivery is a clinically useful method for monitoring outcomes of brief interventions in primary care.},

Little information is available on the extent to which these positive findings will generalize to more routine clinical settings with less selected patients or to a trauma that affects a whole community. The present study addresses these generalization issues. A consecutive series of 91 patients with PTSD resulting from a car bomb which exploded in the centre of Omagh, Northern Ireland in August 1998 were treated with cognitive therapy, along lines advocated by Ehlers and Clark (2000). There were no major exclusion criteria and 53\% of patients had an additional axis I disorder (comorbidity). Therapists were NHS staff with heavy caseloads and modest prior training in CBT for PTSD. A brief training in specialist procedures for PTSD was provided. Patients received an average of eight treatment sessions. Significant and substantial improvements in PTSD were observed. Degree of improvement was comparable to that in previously reported research trials. Comorbidity was not associated with poorer outcome, perhaps because comorbid patients were given more sessions of treatment (average 10 vs 5 sessions). Patients who were physically injured improved less than those who were not physically injured. Overall, the results indicate that the positive findings obtained in research settings generalize well to a frontline, non-selective service.  2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.},

The Partners for Change Outcome Management System (PCOMS) is one application of SCF with significant research support but no studies have been conducted in Spain. This investigation describes the effects of PCOMS in routine practice via a comparison to published PCOMS studies. Material and methods: In a retrospective observational study, PCOMS was implemented with 42 clients treated in routine psychotherapy. Outcomes were measured by the Outcome Rating Scale (ORS) and descriptively compared to PCOMS studies included in a meta-analysis and a PCOMS benchmarking study regarding reliable and/or clinically significant change, no change, and deterioration. Results: The current study achieved similar rates of reliable and clinically significant change (73.8\%) to the benchmarking study (65.6\%) and the RCTs (67.5\%). Regarding no change rates, the current study (23.8\%) mirrored results of the RCTs (25.6\%) and was better than the benchmarking study (35.4\%). The current study incurred a low 2.4\% deterioration rate compared to a 10.7\% and 7.0\% rate of the benchmarking study and RCTs, respectively. Conclusions: While not without flaws, this pilot study offers some evidence that the improved outcomes associated with PCOMS may also occur in psychotherapy settings in Spain.

Despite numerous cross-sectional studies examining this question, no large-scale longitudinal study has assessed within-therapist changes in outcomes over time. Method: The present study examined changes in psychotherapists' outcomes over time using a large, longitudinal, naturalistic psychotherapy data set. The sample included 6,591 patients seen in individual psychotherapy by 170 therapists who had on average 4.73 years of data in the data set (range = 0.44 to 17.93 years). Patient-level outcomes were examined using the Outcome Questionnaire-45 and a standardized metric of change (prepost d). Two-level multilevel models (patients nested within therapist) were used to examine the relationship between therapist experience and patient prepost d and early termination. Experience was examined both as chronological time and cumulative patients seen. Results: Therapists achieved outcomes comparable with benchmarks from clinical trials. However, a very small but statistically significant change in outcome was detected indicating that on the whole, therapists' patient prepost d tended to diminish as experience (time or cases) increases. This small reduction remained when controlling for several patient-level, caseload-level, and therapist-level characteristics, as well as when excluding several types of outliers. Further, therapists were shown to vary significantly across time, with some therapists showing improvement despite the overall tendency for outcomes to decline. In contrast, therapists showed lower rates of early termination as experience increased. Conclusions: Implications of these findings for the development of expertise in psychotherapy are explored.},

Compared with SFD, patients with HYP were younger and had fewer comorbid affective disorders and less impaired life domains, suggesting a closer connection between HYP and ANX. Regarding cognitive-behavioral therapy treatment effects, all diagnostic groups showed comparable significant improvement (d = 0.44-0.64). According to level of anxiety, the SFD sample had significantly lower pretreatment scores than did the ANX and the HYP samples. The results suggest that patients with HYP have an interim position between SFD and ANX, with slightly closer connections to ANX.},

Design: Observational study over a 2-year period. Setting: Young Adults Centre providing psychological services by self-referral ( preprimary care) to Link\"oping, \AA tvidaberg, and Kinda municipalities (combined population 145 000) in \"Osterg\"otland county, Sweden. Participants: 607 young adults (16\textendash 25 years of age); 71\% females (n=429). Intervention: Individually scheduled cognitive behavioural therapy delivered in up to six 45 min sessions structured according to an assessment of the client's mental health problems: anxiety, depression, anxiety and depression combined, or decreased distress without specific anxiety or depression. Primary outcome measures: Pre\textendash post intervention changes in psychological distress (General Health Questionnaire-12, GHQ-12), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale Anxiety/Depression (HADS-A/D). Results: 192 clients (32.5\%) discontinued the intervention on their own initiative and 39 clients (6.6\%) were referred to a psychiatric clinic during the course of the intervention. Intention-to-treat analyses including all clients showed a medium treatment effect size (d=0.64) with regard to psychological distress, and small effect sizes were observed with regard to anxiety (d=0.58) and depression (d=0.57). Restricting the analyses to clients who adhered to the agreed programme, a large effect size (d=1.26) was observed with regard to psychological distress, and medium effect sizes were observed with regard to anxiety (d=1.18) and depression (d=1.19). Lower age and a high initial HADS-A score were the strongest risk factors for non-adherence, and inability to concentrate and thinking of oneself as a worthless person increased the risk for discontinuation. Conclusions: We conclude that provision of psychological services to young people through a self-referral centre has potential to improve long-term mental health in communities, but management of non-adherence remains a central challenge.},

This would be helpful for treatment planning and policy decisions regarding how much therapy is enough. The progress of 125 clients entering psychological treatment in two university training clinics was tracked on a session-by-session basis using a naturalistic design. Recovery and reliable improvement were the bi-nomial events of interest used in a survival analysis that estimated the number of weekly treatment sessions needed to meet criteria. Using survival analysis it was estimated that it would take about 8 sessions for 50\% of clients to show reliable improvement and 21 sessions for about 85\% to meet this criterion. Recovery took more treatment, with 50\% of clients estimated to recover after 14 sessions and 70\% requiring 23. On the basis of the present results we conclude that the present policy of the Australian Government in both the public and private sector regarding the number of sessions needed for clients entering psychological treatments to show a benefit is much less than is, in fact, necessary. The findings of the current study are roughly consistent with those found elsewhere and suggest a minimum benefit should be closer to 20 sessions. The current policy appears to be suitable for only about one-third of clients who carry the burden of psychological illness.},

Results indicated that patients treated for depression, GAD, panic disorder, SAD, and specific phobias evidenced significant reductions in symptoms, irrespective of PD presence, and there was no interaction between PD comorbidity and level of symptom improvement. Among patients treated for OCD, PD pathology negatively impacted OCD symptom improvement. When treatment outcome was determined categorically, PD presence had a deleterious effect on clinical recovery only among patients treated for GAD. Neither the number of PD diagnoses nor PD cluster type moderated results. In conclusion, in most instances (with the exception of GAD and OCD patients), individuals with PDs treated by graduate student trainees within a university training clinic experienced significant mood and anxiety symptom improvement in response to short-term CBT, and these improvements were comparable to those without co-occurring PDs.},

Main outcome measures changes between pre- and post therapy in fatigue (Checklist Individual Strength fatigue subscale), disabilities (Sickness Impact Profile total score), physical functioning (short form 36 health survey subscale) and psychological distress (Symptom checklist 90 total score). Results: At baseline, patients with a history of childhood maltreatment had significantly more limitations and a higher level of psychological distress, but were not more severely fatigued. Change scores on the outcome measures after cognitive behavior therapy did not differ significantly between patients with or without a history of childhood maltreatment, or between the different types of childhood maltreatment. However, patients with a history of childhood maltreatment still experienced more limitations and a higher level of psychological distress after CBT. Conclusions: A history of childhood maltreatment was not related to the treatment response of cognitive behavior therapy for CFS. In patients with a history of childhood maltreatment CFS symptoms can be treated with CBT just as well as those without.},

The clients received an average of 11 therapy sessions. The results suggested that CBT performed by less experienced trainee therapists can be effective. According to client estimations, a statistically significant reduction in symptoms, measured using the Symptoms Checklist, was achieved for seven of nine variables (p Յ .006), as well as a significant increase in satisfaction with life (p Յ .001). Also, the pre- and posttherapy measurements using the Montgomery\textendash\AA sberg Depression Rating Scale showed a statistically significant improvement in the clients' condition. According to the therapists' estimations, 64\% (SD = 32.01) of the clients experienced a significant improvement in their condition. In addition, the results of a survey of client satisfaction demonstrated that the clients were very pleased with the therapy received. Also the therapists were, to a great extent, satisfied with the treatment process itself, including the supervision received, and very satisfied with the client alliance. A correlation analysis between the clients' perceived level of improvement and therapist satisfaction showed a strong correlation between the two variables (r = .50, p {$<$} .005). By including the Comparative Psychotherapy Process Scale (CPPS) in our study it was possible to measure trueness to therapy form. An analysis of the CPPS results confirmed that the form of therapy used at the training site was more strongly CBT than psychodynamic interpersonal treatment (p Յ .001). The CBT subscale score indicated that the therapy was characteristic of CBT, confirming that the interventions used in the therapy belong to the CBT genre.},

Method. Practice-based prospective study. Routine data collected from a National Health Service out-patient clinic for adult clients with OCD is benchmarked against the findings of RCTs. The comparison RCTs were identified using a systematic review methodology. Results. The mean (95\% confidence interval) change in Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale score pre- to post-therapy in the Sheffield clinic was 10.2 (7.1 - 13.3), which compares well with changes of I 1.4 (10.5 - 12.2) for exposure and response prevention trials, 12.9 ( 11.2 - 14.7) for cognitive therapy trials, and 10.6 (8.5 - 12.8) for CBT trials. The Sheffield results fell within the benchmarks derived from the included RCTs. Conclusion. These results indicate that CBT for adults with OCD delivered outside the constraints of a clinical trial is equivalently effective but that this conclusion should be tested further on a larger group of patients.},

Results: Subgroups of clients reported a change in depression, social conflict, and anxiety symptomatology, and overall life satisfaction, depicted by significant quadratic growth curves. Findings also offered exploratory support for a theoretical proposition from CRP that improved relational functioning would correspond to improved affect dysregulation and overall life satisfaction.

More research is needed to evaluate whether severely dissociative patients can improve following specialized inpatient treatment for chronic childhood abuse. The objectives of this study were to investigate symptomatic change in patients attending a 3-month specialized inpatient treatment program for adults with a history of childhood sexual abuse (CSA) and mixed trauma-related disorders. In particular, symptomatic changes in those with and without a complex dissociative disorder I ϩ II (CDD) were contrasted. Fifty-six patients with CSA and trauma-related disorders (including 23 patients with CDD) completed the treatment program and a test battery at precare evaluation, admission, discharge, and at 1-year follow-up. There was an overall symptom reduction in dimensional measures maintained at the 1-year follow-up. Patients with CDD consistently had significantly higher symptom levels than the patients without these disorders. Both patient subgroups showed parallel improvement from admission to follow-up, although those high in dissociation (CDD patients) needed more time to show improvement and were still clinically worse at the end of treatment and at follow-up. The findings were matched by clinically significant changes. The results suggest that adults with reported childhood sexual abuse and mixed trauma-related disorders can improve in symptom severity following a traumabased 3-month inpatient program regardless of CDD status. The high distress level in CDD patients indicates that patients with CDD need treatment that is in part different from the more general treatment of polysymptomatic CSA survivors, addressing the pathological aspects of dissociation more vigorously.},

  abstract = {Background. Intensive Short-Term Dynamic Psychotherapy (ISTDP), as developed by Habib Davanloo, is an intensive emotion-focused psychodynamic therapy with an explicit focus on handling resistance in treatment. A core assumption in ISTDP is that psychotherapeutic effects are dependent on in-session emotional processing in the form of rise in complex transference feelings that occurs when treatment resistance is challenged. Recent research indicates that an unlocking of the unconscious, a powerful emotional breakthrough achieved at a high rise in complex transference feelings, can potentially enhance ISTDP's effectiveness. While ISTDP has a growing evidence base, most of the research conducted has used small samples and has tested therapy delivered by expert therapists. The aims of this study were to evaluate the overall effectiveness of ISTDP when delivered in a tertiary psychotherapy service, and to investigate if having an unlocking of the unconscious during therapy predicted enhanced treatment effectiveness. Methods. A total of 412 patients were included in the analyses. The average length of treatment was 10.2 sessions (SD 13.3). Multilevel growth curve modeling was used to evaluate treatment effectiveness and the association between unlocking the unconscious and outcome. A number of control predictors including type of treatment resistance were selected and included in the analyses. Outcome measures were the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) and the Inventory of Interpersonal Problems (IIP). About half of the patients in the study were treated by therapists in training and the other half by more experienced therapists. Results. Growth curve analyses using the full intention-to-treat sample revealed significant within-group effects of ISTDP on both the BSI and the IIP. Effect sizes were large ({$>$}0.80). Unlocking the unconscious during therapy was associated with significantly larger treatment outcome. The relationship was further moderated by type of treatment resistance. Conclusion. This study adds to the empirical base of Davanloo's ISTDP with confirmed treatment effectiveness in a large-scale patient sample when ISTDP was delivered by therapists with a range of experience.

  abstract = {Despite its demonstrated clinical and economic effectiveness, access to Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for psychosis (CBTp) in routine practice remains low. The UK National Health Service (NHS England) Improving Access to Psychological Therapies for people with Severe Mental Illness (IAPT-SMI) initiative aims to address this problem. We report 14-month outcomes for our psychosis demonstration site. Primary and secondary care and self-referrals were screened to check the suitability of the service for the person. Psychotic symptoms, distress, service use, functioning and satisfaction were measured before and after therapy, by trained assessors. User-defined wellbeing and goal-attainment were rated sessionally. Access to CBTp increased almost threefold (2011/12 accepted referrals/year n = 106; 2012/13, n = 300). The IAPT-SMI assessment protocol proved feasible and acceptable to service users, with paired primary outcomes for 97\% of closed cases. Therapy completion ({$>$}=5 sessions) was high (83\%) irrespective of ethnicity, age and gender. Preliminary pre-post outcomes showed clinical improvement and reduced service use, with medium/high effect sizes. User-rated satisfaction was high. We conclude that individual psychological interventions for people with psychosis can be successfully delivered in routine services using an IAPT approach. High completion rates for paired outcomes demonstrate good user experience, clinical improvement, and potential future cost savings. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Historically, it has been difficult to demonstrate an impact of training in psychological interventions for people with psychosis on routine practice and on patient outcomes. A recent pilot evaluation suggested that postgraduate training in Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for Psychosis (CBTp) increased the delivery of competent therapy in routine services. In this study, we evaluated clinical outcomes for patients receiving therapy from therapists who successfully completed training, and their association with ratings of therapist competence and therapy content., AIMS: To characterize the therapy delivered during training and to inform both a calculation of effect size for its clinical impact, and the development of competence benchmarks to ensure that training standards are sufficient to deliver clinical improvement., METHOD: Paired patient-reported outcome measures (PROMS) were extracted from anonymized therapy case reports, and were matched with therapy ratings for each therapist., RESULTS: Twenty clients received a course of competent therapy, including a high frequency of active therapy techniques, from nine therapists. Pre-post effect size for change in psychotic symptoms was large (d = 1.0) and for affect, medium (d = 0.6), but improved outcomes were not associated with therapist competence or therapy content., CONCLUSIONS: Therapists trained to research trial standards of competence achieved excellent clinical outcomes. Therapy effect sizes suggest that training costs may be offset by clinical benefit. Larger, methodologically stringent evaluations of training are now required. Future research should assess the necessary and sufficient training required to achieve real-world clinical effectiveness, and the cost-effectiveness of training.},

It remains unclear what makes some individuals more likely to respond to this form of treatment than others. Forty-eight patients participated in this study using a GSH programme for binge eating. Profiles of treatment completers and non-completers are compared, and reasons for noncompletion explored. Completion of treatment was associated with significant improvements in mood, general functioning and on measures of dietary restraint, frequency of objective binge eating (OBE), laxative misuse, self-induced vomiting (SIV) and driven exercise. Improvements were maintained at follow-up. Treatment non-completers reported significantly higher pre-treatment levels of depression and weight concern, and lower levels of general health and vitality. Reasons for discontinuing treatment were related to perceptions of the GSH programme; practicalities of the programme; and readiness to change. Whilst GSH can be effective for a sub-group of patients, factors such as pre-morbid level of depression, degree of weight concern, perceptions of the programme, and readiness to change may increase the likelihood of non-completion.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Anxiety and depression are common in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and have been linked to clinical recurrence. Previous randomized controlled trials (RCT's) have found no evidence that psychological interventions enhance outcomes for people with IBD but have recruited patients without distress. This study investigates the clinical benefits of a nonrandomized uncontrolled study of clinic based cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) for people with IBD who had moderate-severe levels of anxiety or low mood and compares the results with a previous RCT of CBT in this population., METHOD: Assessments were completed at baseline and end of treatment and included measures of low mood, generalized anxiety, quality of life (QOL), and symptomatic disease activity. The patient health questionnaire and generalized anxiety disorder 7 measures were the primary outcomes. Results in the form of a standardized effect size of treatment were compared with a previous RCT to consider if CBT had greater benefits for those with distress., RESULTS: Thirty patients were deemed appropriate for CBT, and 28 accepted treatment. The results from this clinic based CBT intervention suggest statistically significant reductions in symptoms of anxiety ({$<$}0.001), low mood ({$<$}0.001), and disease activity (p {$<$} 0.01) and increases in QOL (p {$<$} 0.001). The uncontrolled effect sizes were large and superior to those found in published RCTs., CONCLUSION: This nonrandomized uncontrolled trial of a clinic-based CBT intervention suggests that CBT may have benefits for those with moderate-severe disturbances to mood and that effect sizes can be improved by targeting those with distress. RCTs are required to establish efficacy. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2018 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {By reviewing existing data collected at the Texas A\&M Counseling and Assessment Clinic (CAC) in Bryan, TX, the present investigator seeks to better understand client response to therapy. Each client receiving services at the clinic completes the Outcome Questionnaire 45 (OQ-45) before every counseling session attended. The OQ-45 consists of 45 questions related to present emotional and psychological distress. The main goal of this study is to provide information regarding clients' response to therapeutic interventions as measured by their distress levels on the OQ-45. The OQ-45 is an empirically validated measure widely used throughout psychotherapy settings and has been used in the CAC since 2005. Most of the existing research related to dose-response information obtained via the OQ-45 has been implemented at university student counseling centers with a predominantly Caucasian, affluent, and religious population. The present study seeks to expand the knowledge of the field to a more diverse population and unique training setting for budding psychologists. Survival analyses were conducted and results indicate 13 sessions are necessary for a majority of clients from this rural and low-income population to achieve clinically significant change. Additionally, a mere seven sessions are necessary for a majority of clients to achieve reliable improvement. In a country that continues grow in population size and diversity, more information is needed regarding the mental healthcare system and the response of those seeking therapy, this study provides some of that insight.},

  abstract = {\textcopyright{} 2018 Notwithstanding its empirical status and strong recommendation in clinical practice guidelines, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) continues to be delivered infrequently and with low fidelity on the clinical front lines. Recently, organized efforts and policies within the public sector to disseminate and implement CBT and other evidence-based psychotherapies have yielded encouraging results and provided optimism for bridging the research-to-practice-gap. Following from these efforts, the current article examines the initial impact and experience of the implementation of an individualized approach to CBT training and treatment within the Kaiser Permanente health care system. Initial training outcomes, including changes in general and specific competencies, were assessed using divergent assessment methods within the initial cohort of therapists undergoing training. Initial patient outcomes, including changes in depression and anxiety, were assessed among patients receiving treatment from therapists in training. Results revealed training in and implementation of CBT-D was associated with overall large improvements in therapist competencies and in clinically significant improvements in both depression and anxiety among patients. Findings from the initial phase of dissemination and implementation within a large private system provide support for, and extend recent findings related to, the feasibility and effectiveness of training in and implementation of CBT-D in a real-world context.},

Aims: To evaluate treatment outcomes associated with CBT-E in a NHS Eating Disorders Service for adults with bulimia and atypical eating disorders and to make comparisons with a previously published randomized controlled trial (Fairburn et al., 2009) and ``real world'' evaluation (Byrne, Fursland, Allen and Watson, 2011). Method: Participants were referred to the eating disorder service between 2002 and 2011. They were aged between 18\textendash 65 years, registered with a General Practitioner within the catchment area, and had experienced symptoms fulfilling criteria for BN or EDNOS for a minimum of 6 months. Results: CBTE was commenced by 272 patients, with 135 completing treatment. Overall, treatment was associated with significant improvements in eating disorder and associated psychopathology, for both treatment completers and the intention to treat sample. Conclusions: Findings support dissemination of CBT-E in this context, with significant improvements in eating disorder psychopathology. Improvements to global EDE-Q scores were higher for treatment completers and lower for the intention to treat sample, compared to previous studies (Fairburn et al., 2009; Byrne et al., 2011). Level of attrition was found at 40.8\% and non-completion of treatment was associated with higher levels of anxiety. Potential explanations for these findings are discussed.},

This study aimed to investigate outcomes for BPD patients treated in an MBT programme in a Norwegian specialist treatment unit and compare benefits of the implemented MBT with the unit's former psychodynamic treatment programme. Design. A naturalistic, longitudinal, comparison of treatment effects for BPD patients before and after transition to MBT. Methods. The sample consisted of 345 BPD patients treated in the period 1993\textendash 2013. Before 2008, patients were admitted to a psychodynamic treatment programme (n = 281), after 2008 patients received MBT (n = 64). Symptom distress, interpersonal problems, and global functioning were assessed repeatedly throughout the treatment. Suicidal/self-harming acts, hospital admissions, medication, and occupational status were assessed at the start and end of treatment. Therapists' competence and adherence to MBT was rated and found satisfactory. The statistical method for longitudinal analyses was mixed models. Results. BPD patients in MBT and in the former psychodynamic treatment programme had comparable baseline severity and impairments of functioning. BPD patients in MBT had a remarkably low drop-out rate (2\%), significantly lower than the former treatment. Improvements of symptom distress, interpersonal, global and occupational functioning were significantly greater for MBT patients. Large reductions in suicidal/self-harming acts, hospital admissions, and use of medication were evident in the course of both treatments. Conclusions. The study confirms the effectiveness of MBT for BPD patients and indicates greater clinical benefits than in traditional psychodynamic treatment programmes.},

  abstract = {A program of research aimed at improving the quality of psychological interventions is described. Data from over 10,000 patients were analyzed to understand the association between number of treatment sessions and clinically significant improvement. In addition to a potential dose-response relationship, typical recovery curves were generated for patients at varying levels of disturbance and were used to identify patients whose progress was less than expected ("signal" cases). The consequences of passing this information along to therapists were reported. Analyses of dose-response data showed that 50\% of patients required 21 sessions of treatment before they met criteria for clinically significant improvement. Seventy-five percent of patients were predicted to improve only after receiving more than 40 treatment sessions in conjunction with other routine contacts, including medication in some cases. Identification of signal cases (potential treatment failures) shows promise as a decision support tool, although further research is needed to elucidate the nature of helpful feedback. Outgrowths of this research include its possible contribution to social policy decisions, reductions in the need for case management, use in supervision, and possible effects on theories of change.},

Treatment delivery ranged from 12 to 25 sessions; therapist experience ranged from no prior training to extensive training in CBT; and training and supervision of clinicians in the treatment manual was considerably less than that required in a randomized clinical trial (RCT). Paired t-tests demonstrated significant pre-post reductions in symptoms of PTSD and depression for the flexible application of the treatment. A benchmarking analysis revealed that the moderate-to-large effect sizes found for these variables were similar to those obtained in an RCT of the same treatment. Furthermore, effect sizes on measures of outcomes particularly relevant to this population of mass violence survivors such as functional impairment, use of alcohol and drugs to cope, and use of social support to cope, were also medium to large.

The UK Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) programme, one of the largest training initiatives, relies on competent therapists to successfully deliver cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) and promote good patient outcome.                                         Aims:               To evaluate an IAPT CBT training course by assessing if trainees' clinical skills improve during training and reach competency standards, and to report patient outcome for submitted training cases. To investigate a possible relationship between trainee competence and patient outcome. To explore professional differences during training.                                         Method:                                CBT trainee (                 n                 = 252) competence was assessed via audio recordings of therapy sessions at the beginning, middle and end of training. Patient pre- to post-treatment outcomes were extracted from submitted training cases (                 n                 = 1927). Differences in professional background were examined across competence, academic final grade and tutorial support.                                                        Results:               CBT trainees attained competence by the end of the course with 77\% (anxiety recordings) and 72\% (depression recordings) improving reliably. Training cases reported pre- to post-treatment effect sizes of 1.08\textendash 2.26 across disorders. CBT competence predicted a small variance in clinical outcome for depression cases. Differences in professional background emerged, with clinical psychologists demonstrating greater competence and higher academic grades. Trainees without a core professional background required more additional support to achieve competence.                                         Conclusions:               Part of a new CBT therapist workforce was successfully trained to deliver relatively brief treatment effectively. Trainees without a core profession can be successfully trained to competence, but may need additional support. This has implications for workforce training.},

However, relatively few dissemination efforts have focused on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for individuals with major depression despite evidence indicating its efficacy with this population. A multi-site effectiveness trial of CBT was conducted within the Texas public mental health system. Eighty-three adults with major depression received CBT from community clinicians trained through a workshop and regular consultation with a master clinician. Outcomes were compared to a matched sample of individuals receiving pharmacotherapy. Outcome measures used included the quick inventory of depressive symptomatology and beck depression inventory. Individuals receiving CBT showed greater improvements in depression symptoms than those in the comparison group. Greater pretreatment symptom severity predicted better treatment response, while the presence of comorbid personality disorders was associated with poorer outcomes.},

To address this problem, we trained community clinicians in cognitive processing therapy, an evidence-based treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder, using a Learning Collaborative, an intensive training methodology focused on both clinical training and developing sustainability. Sixty clinicians within 18 agencies began the year-long, team-based Learning Collaborative. Clinicians attended three in-person Learning Sessions, received weekly consultation, and submitted audio-recorded sessions to be rated for fidelity. Clinicians were rostered as approved treatment providers if they completed all training requirements. Additionally, we engaged leadership from each agency to build a sustainable practice. Clinicians trained through the Learning Collaborative demonstrated a high degree of fidelity to the treatment (average competence ratings "satisfactory" to "good"), and most (68\%) were rostered as approved treatment providers. Patients treated by clinician trainees exhibited significant symptom reductions (d = 1.68 and 1.28 for posttraumatic stress and depression symptoms, respectively, among treatment completers). At a 6-month follow-up, 95\% of rostered clinicians and 100\% of agencies with rostered clinicians were still providing the treatment. These results suggest that the Learning Collaborative model is a promising approach for the dissemination and implementation of evidence-based treatments for adult posttraumatic stress disorder.},

Dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT; Linehan, 1993) is one approach that has reported some success in reducing self-harm rates in borderline personality disorder patients, who self-harm frequently, though it remains largely untested outside its original setting. The present study aimed to assess the effectiveness of DBT in self-harming women in an institutional setting in the United Kingdom where self-harm is common. Female patients at Rampton Hospital who were displaying self-harming behaviour and met criteria for borderline personality disorder (N = 10) participated in the full one-year treatment package of DBT. Patients were assessed on self-harm rates and on a number of psychological variables, pre-, during- and post-therapy, including a 6-month follow-up. There was a significant reduction in DSH during therapy, which was maintained at 6-month follow-up. This was paralleled by a reduction in dissociative experiences and an increase in survival and coping beliefs, alongside improvements in depression, suicide ideation, and impulsiveness. The findings are preliminary but the results suggest that DBT might provide an effective treatment for severe self-harm in institutional settings, and also highlight some of the psychological mechanisms that might mediate these improvements in self-harming behaviour.},

This study investigated whether for CBT similar effects can be expected under routine care conditions when the patients are comparable to those examined in RCTs.Method: N=574 CBT patients from an outpatient clinic were stepwise matched to the patients undergoing CBT in the National Institute of Mental Health Treatment of Depression Collaborative Research Program (TDCRP). First, the exclusion criteria of the RCT were applied to the naturalistic sample of the outpatient clinic. Second, propensity score matching (PSM) was used to adjust the remaining naturalistic sample on the basis of baseline covariate distributions. Matched samples were then compared regarding treatment effects using effect sizes, average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) and recovery rates.Results: CBT in the adjusted naturalistic subsample was as effective as in the RCT. However, treatments lasted significantly longer under routine care conditions.Limitations: The samples included only a limited amount of common predictor variables and stemmed from different countries. There might be additional covariates, which could potentially further improve the matching between the samples.Conclusions: CBT for depression in clinical practice might be equally effective as manual-based treatments in RCTs when they are applied to comparable patients. The fact that similar effects under routine conditions were reached with more sessions, however, points to the potential to optimize treatments in clinical practice with respect to their efficiency.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Though many studies have shown that psychotherapy can be effective, psychotherapy available in routine practice may not be adequate. Several methods have been proposed to evaluate routine psychological treatments. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate the combined utility of complementary methods, change-based benchmarking, and end-state normative comparisons, across a range of self-reported psychological symptoms., METHOD: Benchmarks derived from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and normative comparisons were used to evaluate the effectiveness of psychotherapy in a large (N = 9895) sample of clients in university counseling centers (UCCs)., RESULTS: Overall, routine psychotherapy was associated with significant improvement across all symptoms examined. For clients whose initial severity was similar to RCT participants, the observed pre-post effect sizes were equivalent to those in RCTs. However, treatment tended to lead to normative end-state functioning only for those clients who were moderately, but not severely, distressed at the start of psychotherapy., CONCLUSIONS: This suggests that although psychotherapy is associated with an effective magnitude of symptom improvement in routine practice, additional services for highly distressed individuals may be necessary. The methods described here comprise a comprehensive analysis of the quality of routine care, and we recommend using both methods in concert. Clinical or methodological significance of this article: This study examines the effectiveness of routine psychotherapy provided in a large network of counseling centers. By comparing multiple established methods to define outcomes in this sample we provide a detailed understanding of typical outcomes. The findings show that, across several different problem areas, routine psychotherapy provided substantial benefit, particularly to clients in the most distress. However, there is room to improve, especially by increasing the number of clients who return to normal functioning by the end of treatment. Using distinct methods provides complementary answers to the question: How effective is routine psychotherapy?},

Design. The investigation was conducted in an out-patient mood disorders clinic of a large university-affiliated psychiatric hospital. The sample represents a subset of a larger naturalistic database of patients seen in the clinic. Methods. We examined 74 depressed out-patients who received 16 sessions of IPT. The Beck Depression Inventory-ll, administered at pre-treatment and post-treatment, served as a measure of depressive severity. Measures of motivation and therapeutic alliance were collected at the third session. Results. In the entire sample, both the therapeutic alliance and autonomous motivation predicted higher probability of achieving remission; however, the relation differed for those with highly recurrent depression compared to those with less recurrent depression. For those with highly recurrent depression, the therapeutic alliance predicted remission whereas autonomous motivation had no effect on remission. For those with less recurrent depression, both autonomous motivation and the therapeutic alliance predicted better achieving remission. Controlled motivation emerged as a significant negative predictor of remission across both groups. Conclusion. Taken together, these results highlight the possible use of motivation theory to inform and enrich therapeutic conceptualizations and interventions in clinical practice, but also point to the importance of modifying interventions based on the chronicity of a client's depression.},

  abstract = {Background: Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is efficacious, but there remains individual variability in outcomes. Patient's interpersonal problems may affect treatment outcomes, either directly or through a relationship mediated by helping alliance. Interpersonal problems may affect alliance and outcomes differentially in individual and group (CBGT) treatments. The main aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between interpersonal problems, alliance, dropout and outcomes for a clinical sample receiving either individual or group CBT for anxiety or depression in a community clinic. Methods: Patients receiving individual CBT (N = 84) or CBGT (N = 115) completed measures of interpersonal problems, alliance, and disorder specific symptoms at the commencement and completion of CBT. Results: In CBGT higher pre-treatment interpersonal problems were associated with increased risk of dropout and poorer outcomes. This relationship was not mediated by alliance. In individual CBT those who reported higher alliance were more likely to complete treatment, although alliance was not associated with symptom change, and interpersonal problems were not related to attrition or outcome. Limitations: Allocation to group and individual therapy was non-random, so selection bias may have influenced these results. Some analyses were only powered to detect large effects. Helping alliance ratings were high, so range restriction may have obscured the relationship between helping alliance, attrition and outcomes. Conclusions: Pre-treatment interpersonal problems increase risk of dropout and predict poorer outcomes in CBGT, but not in individual CBT, and this relationship is not mediated by helping alliance. Stronger alliance is associated with treatment completion in individual, but not group CBT. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {Purpose -- The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of a brief CBT intervention within a primary care adult mental health service. Design/methodology/approach -- In total, 92 participants with mild to moderate mental health difficulties were provided with five sessions of brief CBT. Clinical improvement was measured using the Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation-Outcome Measure (CORE-OM) at pre-treatment, mid-treatment and post- treatment, and on the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) at pre-treatment and post-treatment. Findings -- The planned five sessions of CBT were completed by 48.9 percent (n=45) of participants. Treatment completers with full clinical data (n=31) showed large statistically significant improvements on the CORE-OM and BDI-II from pre-therapy to post-therapy. Of treatment completers and non-completers with post-therapy and mid-therapy CORE-OM data, respectively (n=34), 61.8 percent showed reliable and clinically significant change. No statistically significant differences were found between treatment completers (n=45) and non-completers (n=47) in their pre-therapy clinical scores or socio-demographic characteristics. Practical implications -- Brief CBT can be a clinically effective primary care intervention but needs to be implemented in a way that ensures high treatment engagement across a range of service users. Originality/value -- This paper contributes to the evidence base of a primary care psychological intervention and demonstrates the importance of assessing treatment completion when evaluating clinical effectiveness.},

Methods: A repeated measures design was used to evaluate the clinical outcomes of service users who completed an intervention. Psychological distress, depressive symptomatology and anxiety symptomatology were measured using the Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation-Outcome Measure (CORE-OM), the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and the Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), respectively. Self-reported health and economic outcomes were measured using the EQ-5D-3L and the Eco-Psy, respectively. Results: A total of 381 adults were assessed as suitable for an APSI intervention, with 198 (52\%) of these completing at least one intervention. Significant reductions in psychological distress were observed for completers of guided self-help and brief cognitive behavioural therapy, with service users also showing significant reductions in anxiety and depressive symptomatology. Reliable and clinically significant change on the CORE-OM was observed for 67.9\% of treatment completers. Service users reported significant improvements in their health status but did not show changes in their health service usage in the 3-month follow-up period. Conclusions: APSI provided an accessible service model that was clinically effective in managing a range of mild to moderate mental health difficulties. The cost-effectiveness of the service model may be enhanced by offering a wider range of high-throughput interventions and by increasing the treatment completion rate.

Analysis of pre-counselling, postcounselling and follow-up measures of mental health and problem ratings indicated levels of change equivalent to those achieved in controlled studies of counselling and psychotherapy with other client groups. Factors in uencing the effectiveness of counselling included gender and employment status. Qualitative client reports suggested that the main bene ts experienced by clients were in the areas of self-understanding and self-belief. For illustrative purposes, data from low-income clients are compared with results from employee counselling clients receiving a similar service.

Patients used an individualized, exposure based, homework manual, derived from their behavioral analysis. Treatment was implemented in an outpatient behavior treatment unit. Method: Patients presented with moderate to severe anxiety, avoidance behavior, functional impairment and depressive symptoms. Treatment was evaluated with a double-baseline case series/pre\textendash post design with four follow-ups. Results: There was a significant and steady improvement in all self-rated outcome measures and participants were satisfied with the services provided. Nine out of 11 patients (82\%) were free of PD+/-AG at 3 months and all patients at 1-year follow-up. The absence of a control group, the small sample and lack of blind assessments, limit the validity of the study. Conclusions: These case studies provide empirical evidence in support of both the feasibility and utility of a single-session behavior treatment (SSBT) plus self-help implemented in a public mental health unit. Further research with a control group is needed to assess the efficacy of the intervention in routine clinical practice.},

Data from more than 800 patients was available at pre-treatment and at one month post-treatment and for around 600 patients at pre-treatment and at 9 months follow-up. Measures reported in this analysis were pain experience and interference, psychological distress (depression and anxiety), self-efficacy, catastrophizing, and walking. Change from pre-treatment to post-treatment and follow-up was assessed with conventional statistical tests, the computation of effect sizes and by the reliable change index (RCI) and clinically significant change (CSC) methodology. These analyses provide evidence of statistical improvement at post-treatment and follow-up and the RCI/CSC methodology suggested that between 1 in 3 and 1 in 7 (depending on the outcome measure) achieved clinically significant gains. There was also evidence that a small percentage of patients (1-2\%) reliably deteriorated during the period of treatment. The limitations in the inferences that can be drawn from this study and of the methodology are discussed. A case is made for the application of benchmarking methods using data from RCTs in order to more fully evaluate practice and to generate better quality practice based evidence.},

Although high recovery rates for PTSD have been demonstrated in randomized controlled trials, these are not always replicated in routine practice, suggesting that training interventions are required to fill the research-practice gap., AIMS: This study investigated the outcomes of a therapist training programme on treating PTSD with trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy (TF-CBT)., METHOD: Twenty therapists from ten IAPT services participated in the training, which consisted of workshops, webinars and consultation sessions over a 6-month period., RESULTS: Feedback indicated that participants found the training highly acceptable. PTSD knowledge and self- and supervisor-rated competence on TF-CBT measures improved following the training and improvements were maintained a year later. Client outcomes on a PTSD measure improved following the training. Participants reported attempts to disseminate learning from the course back to their teams., CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicate that the training programme was successful in improving TF-CBT knowledge, skills and outcomes for IAPT therapists. Tentative support for training 'trauma experts' within IAPT services was found, although institutional constraints and staff turnover may limit the sustainability of the model.},

The proportions of recovered patients on the BAI (63\%) and the BDI (60\%) were higher than those of a comparison effectiveness study. On the specific self-report scales the current sample improved as much as the samples in extant efficacy trials.

A prospective study of psychodynamic psychotherapy with 68 outpatients who were treated by 23 therapists was used. The patients rated the alliance with their therapist early in treatment. Therapist use of psychodynamic techniques was reliably rated by independent clinicians for the same sessions. The therapy outcomes were measured at the end of treatment based on the patients' global symptomatology as well as estimate of improvement across a broad range of functioning. In all models, we controlled for the patients' pretherapy psychiatric severity. Analyses were conducted using multilevel modeling to account for therapist effects. Results revealed that patient rated alliance was significantly related to improvement on a measure of broad band functioning. In addition, alliance and psychodynamic interventions interacted to predict this scale of multidimensional therapy outcome. Further, results showed that several individual psychodynamic techniques interacted with alliance that were meaningfully related to this measure of broad band outcome including (1) linking current feelings or perceptions to the past; (2) focusing attention on similarities among patient's relationships repeated over time, settings, or people; and (3) identifying recurrent patterns in patient's actions, feelings, and experiences. In this sample of outpatient psychodynamic treatments, the dynamic techniques were most effective when provided in the context of strong alliances.},

Results: Within-case variability in adherence ratings was significantly associated with therapy outcomes (accounting for approximately 10\% of the variance in outcomes), after controlling for alliance, between-case variability, and the proportion of outcomes attributed by therapists. Conclusion: The flexibility therapists demonstrate regarding the use of technique within a given treatment appears to be related to better outcomes across their caseload in relation to therapists who are less flexible with their interventions at the individual client level. The clinical implications of flexibility in adherence to a treatment model are discussed.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The current study used multilevel growth mixture modeling to ascertain groups of patients who had similar trajectories in their psychological functioning over the course of short-term treatment., METHOD: A total of 10,854 clients completed a measure of psychological functioning before each session. Psychological functioning was measured by the Behavioral Health Measure, which is an index of well-being, symptoms, and life-functioning. Clients who attended 5 to 25 sessions at 46 different university/college counseling centers and one community mental health center were included in this study. Client diagnoses and the specific treatment approaches were not known., RESULTS: A 3-class solution was a good fit to the data. Clients in classes 1 and 3 had moderate severity in their initial psychological functioning scores, and clients in class 2 had more distressed psychological functioning scores. The trajectory for clients in class 1 was typified by early initial change, followed by a plateau, and then another gain in psychological functioning later in treatment. The trajectory for clients in class 2 demonstrated an initial decrease in functioning, followed by a rapid increase, and then a plateau. Last, the clients in class 3 had a steady increase of psychological functioning, in a more linear manner., CONCLUSION: The trajectories of change for clients are diverse, and they can ebb and flow more than traditional dose-effect and good-enough level models may suggest.

  abstract = {AIMS: To investigate the effectiveness of psychodynamic-interpersonal therapy (PIT) in a routine clinical practice setting. METHODS: Full pre-post data were available on 62 out of a total of 67 patients aged between 19 and 60 years. Patients were seen over a 52-month period (2001-2005) receiving a course of PIT therapy (mean number of sessions = 16.9, median number of sessions = 16). The outcomes were assessed using a range of outcome measures: the 32-item version of the Inventory of Interpersonal Problems (IIP-32), the Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation Outcome Measure (CORE-OM), and the Beck Depression Inventory - Second Edition (BDI-II). Study data were benchmarked against comparative national and local data. RESULTS: There were significant pre-post reductions on all measures: IIP-32 effect size (ES) = 0.56; CORE-OM ES = 0.76; BDI-II ES = 0.76. Reliable and clinically significant change was achieved by 34\% of clients on the BDI-II and by 40\% of clients on the CORE-OM. Clients with high pre-therapy levels of interpersonal problems had poorer outcomes. CONCLUSION: Benchmarking our results against both national and local comparative data showed that our results were less favourable than those obtained where PIT had been used in efficacy trials, but were comparable with reports of other therapies (including cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)) in routine practice settings. The results show that PIT can yield acceptable clinical outcomes, comparable to CBT in a routine care setting, within the context of current limitations of the practice-based evidence paradigm.},

We examined the strength of the relationship between early response and remission in 82 patients who received naturalistic cognitive-behavior therapy in a private practice setting, and 158 patients who received protocol cognitive therapy in a research setting. We predicted that the relationship between early response and remission would be substantial enough to guide clinical decision making in both samples, and that a simple model of severity at Week 4 of treatment would predict remission as effectively as a more complex change score. Logistic regressions showed that a simple model based on the Week 4 Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) score was as predictive of remission as more complex models of early change. A receiver operating characteristics analysis showed that BDI score at Week 4 was substantially predictive of remission in both the naturalistic and research protocol samples; the area under the curve was .80 and .84 in the naturalistic and protocol samples, respectively. To guide clinical decision making, we identified threshold scores on the BDI corresponding to various negative predictive values (probability of nonremission when nonremission is predicted). Our results indicate that depressed patients who remain severely depressed at Week 4 of cognitive therapy are unlikely to reach remission at the end of relatively brief (maximum 20 sessions) treatment. We discuss implications of our findings for clinical decision making and treatment development.},

  abstract = {Premature termination challenges the successful outcomes of psychological treatments for gambling disorder. To date, research has primarily identified clients who are at particular risk for dropping out of treatment. A smaller but growing body of literature has investigated when dropout occurs. Typically, those studies have not considered improvement in psychological distress within their operationalizations of dropout and therefore may have misrepresented when dropout occurs. The current study examined when dropout occurs using an operationalization based on the criteria of attaining reliable change in a naturalistic sample of clients with gambling disorder, and the classification rates yielded from~that operationalization were compared to the rates from~a more common operationalization. Participants (n~=~334) were clients meeting diagnostic criteria for gambling disorder at an outpatient private practice who completed a measure of psychological distress at baseline and prior to each subsequent treatment session. A survival analysis was conducted to determine temporal patterns of treatment dropout (i.e., clients who discontinued treatment before realizing reliable changes in psychological distress) and completion (i.e., clients who discontinued treatment after realizing reliable changes in distress) at each treatment session. Forty-nine percent of clients were classified as dropouts, and the majority of those clients did so in the first few sessions. The more common operationalization of dropout classified clients as dropouts when they had improved in their distress and clients as completers when they had not improved in their distress. Discussion centers on the implications of dropout occurring at various stages of treatment and future directions.},

Interventions Veterans participated in a biopsychosocial evaluation and up to eight BA sessions using a collaborative approach involving primary care, mental health, and other clinicians. A physiatrist assisted the psychologist in providing recommendations to primary care providers. Outcome Measures Participants were administered pre- and posttreatment measures of PTSD, pain severity, pain interference, mental health, quality of life, satisfaction, and global ratings of change with the purpose of assessing progress and improving quality. Results Of the 58 participants, 30 completed treatment. Common recommendations included physical therapy and exercise programs, pain medication or pain medication adjustments, and additional diagnostic workups, such as imaging. Participants who completed the program showed significant improvements on measures of PTSD, pain severity, and pain interference. Improvements were also evident on measures of mental health and quality of life. Overall, participants were satisfied with the program, and on average reported feeling 'somewhat better.' Conclusions These findings suggest that a collaborative approach that includes BA is feasible and a potentially effective treatment for comorbid chronic pain and PTSD.},

Counselling is recommended only when other interventions have failed and its effectiveness has been questioned. Method: A secondary data analysis was conducted of data collected from 33,243 patients across 103 Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) services as part of the second round of the National Audit of Psychological Therapies (NAPT). Initial analysis considered levels of pre-post therapy effect sizes (ESs) and reliable improvement (RI) and reliable and clinically significant improvement (RCSI). Multilevel modelling was used to model predictors of outcome, namely patient pre-post change on PHQ-9 scores at last therapy session. Results: Counselling received more referrals from patients experiencing moderate to severe depression than CBT. For patients scoring above the clinical cut-off on the PHQ-9 at intake, the pre-post ES (95\% CI) for CBT was 1.59 (1. 58, 1.62) with 46.6\% making RCSI criteria and for counselling the pre-post ES was 1.55 (1.52, 1.59) with 44.3\% of patients meeting RCSI criteria. Multilevel modelling revealed a significant site effect of 1.8\%, while therapy type was not a predictor of outcome. A significant interaction was found between the number of sessions attended and therapy type, with patients attending fewer sessions on average for counselling [M = 7.5 (5.54) sessions and a median (IQR) of 6 (3\textendash 10)] than CBT [M = 8.9 (6.34) sessions and a median (IQR) of 7 (4\textendash 12)]. Only where patients had 18 or 20 sessions was CBT significantly more effective than counselling, with recovery rates (95\% CIs) of 62.2\% (57.1, 66.9) and 62.4\% (56.5, 68.0) respectively, compared with 44.4\% (32.7, 56.6) and 42.6\% (30.0, 55.9) for counselling. Counselling was significantly more effective at two sessions with a recovery rate of 34.9\% (31.9, 37.9) compared with 22.2\% (20.5, 24.0) for CBT. Conclusions: Outcomes for counselling and CBT in the treatment of depression were comparable. Research efforts should focus on factors other than therapy type that may influence outcomes, namely the inherent variability between services, and adopt multilevel modelling as the given analytic approach in order to capture the naturally nested nature of the implementation and delivery of psychological therapies. It is of concern that half of all patients, regardless of type of intervention, did not show reliable improvement.},

The Outcome Rating Scale (ORS; Duncan, 2011; Miller \& Duncan, 2004) was used to measure outcomes. Clients had a mean age of 36.7 years and were predominantly female (60.7\%) and White (67.8\%), with 17.7\% being Hispanic, 9.3\% being African American, and 2.8\% being Native American. Forty-six percent were diagnosed with depression, mood, and anxiety disorders; 18.8\% were diagnosed with substance abuse disorders; and 14.4\% were diagnosed with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. A subset of clients with a primary diagnosis of a depressive disorder was compared to treatment efficacy benchmarks derived from clinical trials of major depression. Given that the PBH agency had also implemented an outcome management system, the total sample was also compared to benchmarks derived from clinical trials of continuous outcome feedback., RESULTS: Treatment effect sizes of psychotherapy delivered at the PBH agency were comparable to effect size estimates of clinical trials of depression and feedback. Observed effect sizes were smaller, however, when compared to feedback benchmarks that used the ORS., CONCLUSIONS: Services to the poor and disabled can be effective, and continuous outcome feedback may be a viable means both to improve outcomes and to narrow the gap between research and practice.

  abstract = {Background:               Schema Therapy (ST), a psychotherapy model integrating cognitive, experiential and behavioural interventions, was initially developed and evaluated as an outpatient treatment for patients with severe and chronic disorders, among them Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). Two randomized controlled trials have demonstrated the effectiveness of ST for BPD, delivered in an individual or group format, in the outpatient setting. However, the most severely impaired BPD patients are referred to inpatient treatment due to suicidality and severe self-harm. Specialized inpatient treatment programs are limited, with little evaluative research.               Aims:               The pilot studies are designed to be first steps in naturalistic clinical settings to evaluate the effects of an intensive inpatient ST treatment program.               Method:               This report presents the results of three independent uncontrolled pilot studies with a total of 92 BPD patients. The programs combine individual and group modalities and are consistent theoretically with the ST model for BPD patients.               Results:               Results show that inpatient ST can significantly reduce symptoms of severe BPD and global severity of psychopathology with effect sizes ranging from Cohen's               d               = 2.84 to Cohen's               d               = .43.               Conclusions:               Differences in the effect sizes across the three pilot studies could be explained by length of treatment, number of group psychotherapists and their training. Although there are limitations to the presented pilot studies such as differences in the samples, treatment settings, variations in the treatment itself and the use of different measures, which may have influenced outcome, they are a starting point for describing and evaluating inpatient treatment for BPD in naturalistic settings.},

  abstract = {Objectives: Although cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is an empirically supported treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD), individual differences in the effectiveness of CBT have been observed. Preliminary evidence suggests that positive outcome expectancies for treatment predict better therapy outcomes (Constantino, Arnkoff, Glass, \& Smith, 2011); however, researchers have not examined whether avoidance, an important predictor of depressive symptoms (Ottenbreit \& Dobson, 2004), may play an important role in this association. In the present study, we examined whether the association between positive outcome expectancies and therapy outcome is associated with patients' levels of avoidance. Design: Data were collected as part of a prospective, longitudinal study. Methods: The sample consisted of 51 patients diagnosed with MDD who underwent CBT. Prior to treatment, clinicians rated patients on their levels of avoidance and positive outcome expectancies. A self-report rating of positive outcome expectancies was also obtained, and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II; Beck, Steer, \& Brown, 1996) was completed pre- and post-treatment. A hierarchical regression analysis was conducted to examine the association between positive outcome expectancies and avoidance for predicting changes in depressive symptoms after CBT. Results: For patients with lower levels of positive outcome expectancies, lower levels of avoidance predicted greater improvement after CBT and higher levels of avoidance predicted poorer treatment outcomes. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the impact that lower positive outcome expectancies have on therapy outcome can be attenuated if patients do not avoid dealing with emotionally difficult material in session. Practitioner Points The detrimental effects of lower positive outcome expectancies for therapy may be lessened in patients who do not demonstrate avoidance at the outset of therapy., Clinicians' early reinforcement of patient engagement in therapy may help patients increase their positive outcome expectancies for treatment., The importance of avoidance and lower positive outcome expectancies has only been examined in patients referred for cognitive behavioural therapy in a University Teaching Unit and the findings may not apply to other psychotherapies in other contexts., The interaction between avoidance and positive outcome expectancies has only been examined in patients with major depressive disorder and the findings may not extend to patients with other psychological disorders.},

While there is first evidence about predictors of nonresponse in outpatient psychotherapy, there are currently no studies investigating predictors of nonresponse in inpatient settings. Based upon a previous systematic literature review, we analyzed the predictive value of initial patient characteristics on nonresponse in symptom distress. Methods: Treatment episodes from 546 patients, treated for at least 4 weeks, were assessed under naturalistic conditions. Nonresponse status (i.e., lack of a reliable improvement in symptom distress) was investigated at four different time points: at week 4, at discharge, and at a two follow-ups (3 and 12 months after discharge). Hierarchical binary logistic regression models were used to predict nonresponse. Sociodemographic data, clinical variables, and the previous response status were entered subsequently in the model. Results: A moderate or functional level of initial symptom distress, a comorbid personality disorder, and previous nonresponse were the most consistent predictors of nonresponse. Conclusions: The results point to the importance of early outcome assessment and suggest the implementation of more symptom-specific treatments.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Worldwide, health systems are improving access to empirically supported psychological therapies for anxiety and depression. Evaluations of this effort are limited by the cross sectional nature of studies, short implementation periods, poor data completeness rates and lack of clinically significant and reliable change metrics. OBJECTIVE: Assess the impact of implementing stepped care empirically supported psychological therapies by measuring the prospective outcomes of patients referred over a two year period to one Improving Access to Psychological Therapies service in the UK. METHOD: We collected demographic, therapeutic and outcome data on depression (PHQ-9) and anxiety (GAD-7) from 7859 consecutive patients for 24 months between 1st July 2006 and 31st August 2008, following up these patients for a further one year. RESULTS: 4183 patients (53\%) received two or more treatment sessions. Uncontrolled effect size for depression was 1.07 (95\% CI: 0.88 to 1.29) and for anxiety was 1.04 (0.88 to 1.23). 55.4\% of treated patients met reliable improvement or reliable and clinically significant change criteria for depression, 54.7\% for anxiety. Patients received a mean of 5.5 sessions over 3.5h, mainly low-intensity CBT and phone based case management. Attrition was high with 47\% of referrals either not attending for an assessment or receiving an assessment only. CONCLUSIONS: Recovery rates for patients receiving stepped care empirically supported treatments for anxiety and depression in routine practice are 40 to 46\%. Only half of all patients referred go on to receive treatment. Further work is needed to improve routine engagement of patients with anxiety and depression.},

  abstract = {Objectives: Intensive outpatient programs (IOPs) have become increasingly common for treating highly distressed patients, and a burgeoning number of IOPs are based on, or informed by, dialectical behavior therapy (DBT). The goal of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness of DBT in a community mental health center IOP for patients with heterogeneous diagnoses. Method: Using a within-subjects design, we examined changes in depression, anxiety, mindfulness, and hope during DBT treatment in a community mental health center in the Midwestern United States. The final sample comprised 56 participants (59\% female) ranging in age from 18 to 73 years, with a mean age of 36.8 years (standard deviation = 13.7). The majority of participants (80\%) met criteria for a mood disorder, just over half met criteria for an anxiety disorder, and 20\% met criteria for comorbid substance abuse or dependence. Over half met criteria for more than one diagnosis. Length of treatment varied based on the needs of the individual patient; treatment ranged from 2 to 16 weeks, with an average stay of 6 weeks. Results: Depression and anxiety scores decreased significantly and hope scores increased significantly over the course of treatment (all p's {$<$} .001).Mindfulness scores did not increase significantly, although changes did occur in the predicted direction. In addition, the extent to which hope and mindfulness increased over the course of treatment predicted final depression and anxiety scores after controlling for baseline symptom levels. Conclusions: Results suggest that this DBT-informed intervention was effective in reducing depression and anxiety and increasing hope. Because of the move away from inpatient hospitalizations over the last few decades, it is incumbent on the field to find alternative ways to treat patients in need of more acute, intensive care. Moreover, these treatments must be cost effective, as many of these patients have limited financial resources. Group therapy formats might provide an appropriate and needed bridge for this coverage gap. The results of this study suggest that a DBT-informed IOP might be an amenable treatment for this population. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)},

In the present study, four aspects of clinical outcome were analyzed using a sample of highly experienced psychotherapists (mean years of experience as therapy practitioners = 30) who also serve as clinical teachers. The four aspects were: (1) overall change in different outcome domains, including long-term outcome; (2) outcome with clinically distressed clients (i.e. clients above the level of clinical disturbance at pretreatment); (3) level of drop-out; and (4) the degree to which clients re-entered treatment during the follow-up period. Participants were 48 clients treated by 18 therapists. Treatments were open-ended, 'therapy as usual', mostly within the setting of independent private practice. Outcome measurements included the OQ-45.2 and IIP-64, with repeated measurements during therapy and extended long-term follow up (up to 3.5 years). Cohen's d effect sizes and multilevel growth trajectories were estimated for patient change in symptomatic and interpersonal distress. The findings indicate that these therapists obtain very good outcomes overall, particularly with clients above cut-off for clinical disturbance. Moreover, there was a high level of maintenance and increase of treatment gains over time. No clients dropped out. Overall, the findings suggest that a sample of highly experienced therapists obtains particularly good outcomes as defined in more comprehensive terms than what is typical in psychotherapy research. Implications for the understanding of therapeutic success and clinical expertise are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)},

The program includes psychoeducation, breathing retraining, and cognitive restructuring, with treatment closely coordinated with clients' community support treatment teams. A pilot study was conducted and included clients with PTSD and SMI (such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder) to evaluate the safety, feasibility, and preliminary clinical effectiveness of the program. Retention rate in the treatment was 86\% with no serious adverse clinical events reported. Clinical outcomes were good, with reductions in PTSD diagnoses, based on the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS), from 100\% at baseline to 64\% at post-treatment and 50\% at three-month follow-up. Clients also experienced significant reductions in the affect subscale (depression and anxiety) of the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) from baseline to the three-month follow-up. The results support the feasibility and potential clinical effectiveness of the CBT program for PTSD in the SMI, and suggest the intervention should be evaluated in a randomized clinical trial.

A number of research results support the efficacy of integrative treatments, such as Safran's metatherapeutic approach to working with patient\textendash therapist intersubjective experience (Safran \& Muran, 2000), highlighting therapist responsiveness to patient needs rather than strict adherence to manualized protocols as predictors of overall outcome (e.g., Katz et al., 2019; Owen \& Hilsenroth, 2014). This study of early treatment sessions tested competing hypotheses that the trainee therapists would either demonstrate therapeutic processes consistent with the program's psychodynamic training model or evidence of the ``smuggling hypothesis'' (Ablon \& Jones, 1998), a psychodynamic therapist's tendency to borrow prototypical cognitive\textendash{} behavioral processes and interventions found in a naturalistic sample of experienced self-identified psychodynamic clinicians (Ablon, Levy, \& Katzenstein, 2006). Results using the Psychotherapy Process Q-Set (Jones, 2000) suggested that treatment-as-usual for the sample of trainees was more consistent with a cognitive\textendash{} behavioral therapy ideal prototype, supporting the latter prediction. Trainee therapists also demonstrated the ability to help their patients reduce self-reported symptoms within the first 3 months of psychotherapy and alliance significantly predicated reliable change, consistent with the broader psychotherapy research literature. Implications of the findings for psychotherapy training are discussed.},

The present article reports the results of a practice-based evidence (PBE) study, and demonstrates the value of PBE as a research strategy for the empirical evaluation of spiritually oriented psychotherapies (SOPs). This approach involves examining the effectiveness of SOPs in routine settings, providing more externally valid results than randomized controlled trials. Outcome and process data for 304 clients at a private, religious, university counseling center were examined using a PBE methodology. Clinicians integrated a wide variety of spiritual interventions with various secular treatments. The therapist, low initial spiritual distress, and client desire to discuss spirituality in session predicted the frequency with which spiritual interventions were used. The results of multiple hierarchical linear models suggested that clients improved substantially in multiple domains of functioning. The frequency of use of spiritual interventions was not a significant predictor of differential growth trajectories for clients. This study provides an example of how PBE can be used to explore and evaluate the effectiveness of the types of spiritual interventions practitioners employ in their practices.

The study included 19 patients with symptomatic paroxysmal (intermittent) atrial fibrillation who were assessed pre- and posttreatment and at 6-month follow-up. The CBT lasted 10 weeks and included exposure to physical sensations similar to AF symptoms, exposure to avoided situations or activities, and behavioral activation. We observed large within-group improvements on the primary outcome AF-specific quality of life measurement AFEQT posttreatment (Cohen's d = 1.54; p {$<$} . 001) and at 6-month follow-up (d = 1.15; p {$<$} . 001). We also observed improvements in self-reported frequency and severity of AF symptoms. All participants completed the treatment and treatment satisfaction was high.

  abstract = {Homeless individuals experience higher rates of mental illness than the general population, though this group is less likely to receive evidence-based psychological treatment for these difficulties. One explanation for this science-to-service gap may be that most empirically supported interventions are designed to address a single disorder, which may not map on to the substantial comorbidity present in safety-net samples, and create a high training burden for often underresourced clinicians who must learn multiple protocols to address the needs of their patients. One solution may be to prioritize the dissemination of transdiagnostic interventions that can reduce therapist burden and simultaneously address comorbid conditions. The purpose of the present article is to describe the process of conducting a pilot study administering the Unified Protocol (UP), a transdiagnostic treatment for the range of emotional disorders, at a community-based organization that provides health care and other services to homeless individuals and families in Boston, Massachusetts. Therapists on a specialized behavioral health unit received didactic training in the intervention, followed by weekly consultation while they provided the UP to patients on their caseload.

  abstract = {Objective: This study evaluated the success of implementing cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) in a representative clinical practice setting and compared the patient outcomes with those of previously published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of CBT for CFS. Method: The implementation interventions were the following: spreading information about the new treatment setting to general practitioners and CFS patients; training mental health center (MHC) therapists in CBT for CFS; and organizing changes in the MHC patient workflow. Patient outcomes were documented with validated self-report measures of fatigue and physical functioning before and after treatment. The comparison of the treatment results with RCT results was done following the benchmark strategy. Results: One-hundred forty-three CFS patients were referred to the MHC, of whom 112 started treatment. The implementation was largely successful, but a weak point was the fact that 32\% of all referred patients dropped out shortly after or even before starting treatment. Treatment effect sizes were in the range of those found in the benchmark studies. Conclusions: CBT for CFS can successfully be implemented in an MHC. Treatment results were acceptable, but the relatively large early dropout of patients needs attention. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

A total of 22.9\% of patients with AN terminated therapy prematurely (drop-outs), compared to 40.6\% of patients with BN. Group differences between drop-outs and completers show that the group of drop-outs with BN had higher values in the depression score at the start of therapy and was almost two times more likely to have a comorbid disorder (odds ratio 1.69), whereas drop-outs with AN had higher values in the outcome-scale drive for thinness and the odds ratio for being employed or living in a partnership was slightly lower. Completers and drop-outs did not differ significantly within groups in regard to age, body mass index at the start and end of therapy, or the number of comorbid disorders. On the whole, the therapy effect in the group of drop-outs was relatively moderate. For patients with AN, even higher therapy effects were observed among the drop-outs than among the completers. These data suggest that moderate therapy effects and responses can be achieved even among the drop-outs. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Although the model has been partly validated, little is known about the types of trajectories in the specific domains and about the transferability of the model to treatments of longer duration. This study tested whether the domain-specific change trajectories followed a loglinear curve as postulated by the Phase model. Furthermore, it was examined whether the speed of change differed between the domains. Method: Growth curves were modeled using hierarchical linear modeling on an outpatient sample (N = 351), with treatment duration averaging 52 sessions. Results: A log-linear curve best explained the change trajectories of the domains Well-being and Symptoms as well as the Global score of psychopathology, whereas Interpersonal functioning tends to improve in a linear pattern. Estimated slopes were biggest for Well-being and smallest for Interpersonal functioning. Conclusions: In the present study, the predictions of the Phase model concerning multidimensional phases were validated. The finding that trajectories of change are not uniformly log-linear, but either log-linear or linear in a domain-specific manner, is partly inconsistent with the model.},

The paradigm of reliable and clinically significant change was used to explore individual as well as group change. The relationship between demographic variables, intervention length and outcome was investigated.Results, conclusions and implications: Sixty-six per cent of the group with complete outcome data (n=458) showed reliable improvement and 45\% also showed clinically significant improvement after the intervention. Ethnicity was not related to outcome, suggesting that the service was not culturally biased in this respect (although clients from ethnic minorities were significantly underrepresented in the sample of clients who attended). Women and employed clients were more likely to show improvement. Unemployed men had comparatively poor outcomes. There was a positive relationship between length of intervention and improvement. As is often the case, client and data attrition were high: the small sample for which complete outcome data were available reduced the representativeness and generalisability of the findings which must therefore be treated with caution. Issues of attrition must be addressed in future to ensure that data quality is sufficient to increase confidence in using it for service management, development and 'benchmarking'. However, the study adds to the growing body of 'practice-based evidence' supporting the provision of primary care psychology and counselling services. The findings suggest that the employment status and gender of clients may both need to be considered when 'benchmarking' outcomes},

Aim:               The current study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of CBT-E within an out-patient eating disorder service in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia, and incorporated a follow-up assessment period of approximately 20 weeks post-treatment.               Method:               The study involved 114 adult females with a diagnosed eating disorder, who attended an average of 20\textendash 40 individual CBT-E sessions with a psychologist or a psychiatry registrar between 2009 and 2013.               Results:               Of those who began treatment, 50\% did not complete treatment, and the presence of psychosocial and environmental problems predicted drop-out. Amongst treatment completers, statistically and clinically significant improvements in eating disorder and general psychopathology were observed at post-treatment, which were generally maintained at the 20-week follow-up. Statistically significant improvements in eating disorder and general psychopathology were observed amongst the total sample.               Conclusions:               The findings, which were comparable to the previous Australian effectiveness study of CBT-E, indicate that CBT-E is an effective treatment for adults with all eating disorders within out-patient settings. Given the high attrition rate, however, minimizing drop-out appears to be an important consideration when implementing CBT-E within clinical settings.},

Method: Participants were therapists (n = 12) and clients (n = 116; mean age = 41 years, 63\% women) presenting for treatment of depression at a not-for-profit and designated community mental health center for St. Joseph County, Indiana. The training model included a 2-day workshop followed by 1 year of phone consultations. CBT competence ratings from the Cognitive Therapy Scale were obtained prior to training and at 6 and 12 months posttraining. Two different groups of clients, a treatment-as-usual (TAU) group (n = 74) and a CBT group (n = 42), were compared with respect to decrease in symptoms of depression (assessed with the Beck Depression Inventory) and anxiety (assessed with the Beck Anxiety Inventory). Results: Therapists showed significant increases in total scores from pretraining to 6 months posttraining, increases that were maintained at 12 months. The increase in the total score reflected gains on items that specifically measure CBT skills and structure. Although both TAU and CBT resulted in a significant decrease in depressive symptoms, the CBT clients showed significantly greater change than the TAU clients, F(2, 113) = 53.40, p {$<$} .001. The CBT clients also showed a significant decrease in anxiety symptoms, whereas the TAU clients did not. Conclusions: Although there remains a significant amount to learn to guide researchers' mission of improving the availability and effectiveness of treatment for individuals with depression, this study demonstrates that an empirically supported treatment can be implemented in a community mental health center and may result in improved outcomes.

Assessments of problem gambling severity, psychosocial impairment, and alcohol use were undertaken at baseline and post-treatment and evaluated within a counterfactual framework. Findings showed that the contrast between routine CBT for pokies and horse betting had a significant effect, indicative of a 62\% lower gambling urge score if routine CBT recipients had all been horse/track betters opposed to gambling with "pokies."

Method: Study 1 derived aggregated uncontrolled effect sizes and clinically significant change rates for the CBT and control conditions of randomised controlled trials (RCTs), with critical values for demonstrating equivalence to RCTs and superiority to control conditions for anxiety disorders and depression. Study 2 provided benchmarks for demonstrating equivalence, and superiority to other student clinics. Study 3 calculated outcome effect sizes and clinically significant change rates of 342 consecutive CTAD clients allocated to student psychologists between 2009 and 2015, who provided at least two questionnaires, attended at least three sessions and were primarily seen by a student therapist. Aggregated point prevalence estimates of key demographic characteristics of studies contributing to benchmarks were provided. Results: RCT CBT produced higher effect sizes than student clinics, but similar rates of clinically significant change. The application of benchmarking to CTAD illustrated that evaluations of student psychologist effectiveness would differ depending on the benchmark used. Conclusion: We have provided best-available benchmarks for evaluating student-led adult outpatient CBT which we encourage other student clinics to adopt. The benchmarking approach provided a profile of CTAD's strengths and weaknesses. Examples of how benchmark comparisons could be used to inform service improvement were provided.},

  abstract = {Objectives Whether personality characteristics have an impact on treatment outcome is an important question in psychotherapy research. One of the most common approaches for the description of personality is the five-factor model of personality. Only few studies investigated whether patient personality as measured with the NEO-Five-Factor Inventory ( NEO- FFI, Costa \& McCrae [1992b]. Revised NEO- PI-R and NEO- FFI. Professional manual. Odessa, FL: Psychological Assessment Recources) predicts outcome. Results were inconsistent. Studies reporting personality to be predictive of outcome did not control for baseline symptoms, while studies controlling initial symptoms could not support these findings. We hypothesized that after taking into account baseline symptoms, the NEO- FFI would not predict outcome and tested this in a large sample of inpatients at a psychosomatic clinic. Design Naturalistic, non-controlled study using patients' data for multiple regression analysis to identify predictors of outcome. Methods Data of 254 inpatients suffering primarily from depressive, anxiety, stress, and somatoform disorders were analysed. Personality was assessed at the beginning of therapy. For psychotherapy outcome, changes in anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale; HADS), overall psychopathology (Symptom Checklist-90-R Global Severity Index [ GSI]), and interpersonal problems (Inventory of Interpersonal Problems; IIP) were measured. Results The treatment resulted in significant decreases on all outcome measures corresponding to moderate to large effect sizes ( HADS: d = 1.03; GSI: d = 0.90; IIP: d = 0.38). Consistent with our hypothesis, none of the personality domains predicted outcome when baseline symptoms were controlled for. Conclusions Personality assessment at baseline does not seem to have an added value in the prediction of inpatient psychotherapy outcome beyond initial symptoms. Practitioner points Clinical implications Personality dimensions overlap with symptomatic distress., Rather than serve as predictors of outcome, the domains tapped by the NEO- FFI reflect current psychological symptomatology in inpatients with depressive, anxiety, stress or somatoform disorders., From a clinician's point of view monitoring individual progress by using actuarial measures is more valuable than trying to predict who will benefit from treatment using personality assessments., Limitations of the study Diagnostic assessment was solely based on clinical evaluation rather than structured interviews., Twenty-five per cent of the original sample had to be excluded due to missing data., There was a focus on only one set of client characteristics (i.e., five-factor model personality traits)., Assessment of personality domains in the acute phase of a mental disorder may be problematic and could have influenced findings.},

Methods: Inpatients routinely treated at a university hospital for psychosomatics and psychotherapy in Germany were assessed before and after receiving a psychodynamically oriented multimodal treatment. As primary outcome response rates based on the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R) were used. As secondary outcomes, pre-post effect sizes on measures of symptoms and stress (SCL-90-R, Hospital anxiety and depression scale, Perceived stress questionnaire) as well as interpersonal problems (IIP) were determined. Additionally, the relationship of the helping alliance to outcome was examined. Results: A total of 709 patients with various primary diagnoses and high mental (72.4\%) and physical (61\%) comorbidity, receiving on average 7.9 weeks of treatment, were included. The response rate based on the SCL90-R global severity index was 62.9\% at posttreatment and 60.4\% at short-term follow up. Pre-post effect sizes on symptom and stress measures were large (Cohen's d {$\geq$} 1.0) while change regarding interpersonal problems was small (d = 0.34). For patients responding to treatment a significantly better helping alliance was found, corresponding to a large effect (d = 0.84). Conclusions: A majority of patients benefitted considerably from a psychosomatic inpatient treatment in terms of response and pre-post effects. Response was significantly related to the quality of the therapeutic alliance. Monitoring and improving alliance may enhance treatment outcome.},

Rates of RCSI and reliable improvement and mean pre- and post-treatment changes were similar at all tested treatment durations. Patients seen in different service sectors showed modest variations around this pattern., CONCLUSIONS: Results were consistent with the responsive regulation model, which suggests that in routine care participants tend to end therapy when gains reach a good-enough level.

Further, client preferences have been found to play an important role in determining premature termination and therapy outcomes. However, our current understanding of this client variable is limited because of the methodologies that have previously been used to assess these preferences. In this study, 57 adult clients from a university-based psychology department clinic completed an instrument weighing preferences for intervention specific empirical support against preferences for 4 other common factor variables. These clients were found to discount a significant amount of intervention empirical support to ensure the following: (a) a satisfactory therapeutic relationship could be developed, (b) their therapist would be empathetic and accepting, (c) their therapist would have a greater level of experience, and (d) they, as clients, would do more of the talking during sessions. These findings suggest that clients prefer treatment decisions to be based on variables other than intervention empirical support alone. Recommendations are made for assessing and including client preferences to provide more individually tailored interventions. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

The current study examined the effectiveness of modular therapy in a community clinic serving patients with a wide variety of diagnoses and complex problems. Records were reviewed for 291 adult psychotherapy outpatients; 120 patients received modular therapy and 171 received a single EST. First, the two treatment approaches were compared using a propensity score weighting procedure to correct for the lack of random assignment. Results indicated that there were no significant differences between the treatment types on measures of functional improvement. Next, the effectiveness of modular therapy in the current clinic was assessed using a meta-analytic benchmarking strategy. Results indicated that the unstandardized effect size outcomes for therapist rated improvement were similar to benchmarks from prior research studies. Depressed patients in the current sample showed less improvement compared to prior efficacy studies, but had similar improvement to prior effectiveness studies. Treatment implications and future research directions of these findings were discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

DESIGN: Longitudinal data collected in the course of an uncontrolled evaluation of a large-scale CBT-I training program. SETTING: Outpatient and residential treatment facilities. PARTICIPANTS: Four hundred five Veterans presenting for treatment of insomnia. INTERVENTIONS: Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I). MEASUREMENT AND RESULTS: At baseline, 32\% of patients, compared with 21\% at final assessment, endorsed some level of suicidal ideation [[chi](2)(df = 1) = 125; P {$<$} 0.001]. After adjusting for demographic variables and baseline insomnia severity, each 7-point decrease in Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) score achieved during CBT-I treatment was associated with a 65\% (OR = 0.35; 95\% CI = 0.24 to 0.52) reduction in odds of suicidal ideation. The effect of change in insomnia severity on change in depression severity was also significant. After controlling for change in depression severity and other variables in the model, the effect of change in insomnia severity on change in suicidal ideation remained significant. CONCLUSION: This evaluation of the largest dissemination of CBT-I in the United States found a clinically meaningful reduction in suicidal ideation among Veterans receiving CBT-I. The mechanisms by which effective treatment of insomnia with CBT-I reduces suicide risk are unknown and warrant investigation. The current results may have significant public health implications for preventing suicide among Veterans.},

This study aimed to add to the evidence regarding the effectiveness of CBT when delivered in a routine clinical setting. The participants were 203 adults presenting with a range of eating disorder diagnoses, who were offered CBT in an out-patient community eating disorders service in the UK. Patients completed measures of eating disorder pathology at the start of treatment, following the sixth session, and at the end of treatment. Symptoms of anxiety, depression, and psychosocial functioning were measured pre- and post-treatment. Approximately 55\% of patients completed treatment, and there were no factors that predicted attrition. There were significant improvements in eating disorder psychopathology, anxiety, depression and general functioning, with particular changes in eating attitudes in the early part of therapy. Effect sizes were medium to large for both completer and intention to treat analyses. These findings confirm that evidence-based forms of CBT can be delivered with strong outcomes in routine clinical settings. Clinicians should be encouraged to deliver evidence-based treatments when working in these settings.},

Yet, the generalizability of efficacy results to daily practice (effectiveness) might be diminished by the design of RCTs. The STAR*D trial approached daily practice as much as possible, but still has some properties of an RCT. In this study, we compare results from treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) in routine clinical practice to those of RCTs and STAR*D., METHODS: Effectiveness in routine clinical practice was compared with efficacy results from 15 meta-analyses on antidepressant, psychotherapeutic and combination treatment and results from STAR*D. Data on daily practice patients and treatments were derived from a routine outcome monitoring (ROM) system. Treatment outcome was defined as proportion of remitters (MADRS {$<$}=10) and within-group effect size., RESULTS: From ROM, 598 patients suffering from a MDD episode according to the MINI-plus were included. Remission percentages were lower in routine practice than in meta-analyses for all treatment modalities (32 vs.40-74\%). Differences were less explicit for antidepressants (21 vs. 34-47\%) than for individual psychotherapy (27 vs. 34-58\%; effect size 0.85 vs. 1.71) and combination therapy (21 vs. 45-63\%), since only 60\% of the meta-analyses for antidepressants showed significant differences with ROM, while for psychotherapy and combination treatment almost all meta-analyses showed significant differences. No differences in effectiveness were found between routine practice and STAR*D (antidepressants 27 vs. 28\%; individual psychotherapy 27 vs. 25\%; combination treatment 21 vs. 23\%, respectively)., CONCLUSIONS: Effectiveness of treatment for mild-to-moderate MDD in daily practice is similar to STAR*D and significantly lower than efficacy results from RCTs.

The design aimed to close the gaps between clinical practice, supervision and formal training; facilitate translation of theory into practice; and integrate findings from the 'common factors' research into effectiveness of psychotherapy. Training and supervision methods were linked and focused on emerging issues in clinical practice and the development of students' capacity for critical reflection and a research attitude to practice. The evaluation was a naturalistic study which used quantitative and qualitative methodology within the action research framework to reflect on the impact of the training on the participants, the organisation and the clinical practice.

Intensifying treatment to increase patient retention is a promising development. Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of an intensive traumafocused treatment programme over 8 days for individuals suffering from severe PTSD. Method: Treatment was provided for 347 PTSD patients (70\% women; mean age = 38.32 years, SD = 11.69) and consisted of daily sessions of prolonged exposure and eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) therapy (16 sessions in total), physical activity, and psycho-education. All participants had experienced multiple traumas, including sexual abuse (74.4\%), and suffered from multiple comorbidities (e.g. 87.5\% had a mood disorder). Suicidal ideation was frequent (73.9\%). PTSD symptom severity was assessed by both clinician-rated [Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS)] and self-report [PTSD Symptom Scale Self Report (PSS-SR) and Impact of Event Scale (IES)] inventories. For a subsample (n = 109), follow-up data at 6 months were available. Results: A significant decline in symptom severity was found (e.g. CAPS intention-to-treat sample Cohen's d = 1.64). At post-treatment, 82.9\% showed a clinically meaningful response and 54.9\% a loss of diagnosis. Dropout was very low (2.3\%). Conclusions: Intensive trauma-focused treatment programmes including prolonged exposure, EMDR therapy, and physical activity can be effective for patients suffering from severe PTSD and are associated with low dropout rates.},

One hundred forty-9 students (102 women; MAge ϭ 24.55, SD ϭ 3.35) were consecutively interviewed and extensively assessed by independent clinicians of the Service before and after the intervention, using the Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation and the Global Assessment Scale. Patients were enrolled in an individual psychotherapy and allocated to cognitive behavior or psychodynamic approach according to specific criteria. Psychotherapists who were not involved in the assessment phase administered the treatment. The majority of students was female and the most severe conditions emerged among students enrolled in philosophy, arts, and communication and medical schools. At posttreatment, all students improved both in terms of well-being and distress, regardless of the type of psychotherapy received. This improvement emerged both by students' self-report and clinicians' evaluations.

  abstract = {Background and Objectives: The dissemination and delivery of psychological therapies for people with psychosis has been limited by workforce and organisational factors. 'Low Intensity' (LI) delivery, whereby staff are trained to deliver brief, focused, manualised interventions, may be one way of improving access. In this study, we piloted a new LI intervention specifically for people with psychosis, aimed at helping people to reach a personal recovery goal, whilst targeting anxious avoidance or depression-related inactivity. Frontline mental health workers were trained to deliver the intervention. We report here on the impact of the intervention on therapeutic outcomes.Methods: Twelve people with psychosis and either anxious avoidance or low mood, who wanted to work towards a personal goal, completed the intervention and a battery of assessments of mood, functioning and psychotic symptoms.Results: Eleven out of the twelve participants achieved their personal goals. The results of a series of Friedman K related sample tests revealed significant improvements in depression, clinical distress, activity levels, negative symptoms and delusions across the three time points, and no change in hallucinations, or anxious avoidance. Staff and participant satisfaction was high.Limitations: The study is a small uncontrolled pilot study. Outcomes should therefore be interpreted with caution, pending replication.Conclusions: The new LI intervention shows preliminary evidence of effectiveness and is a feasible model of therapy delivery for people with psychosis. The results suggest that frontline mental health workers can be trained relatively easily to deliver the intervention. A larger, randomised controlled trial is warranted to determine the effectiveness of the intervention and training programme.},

Method: Patients included 981 Veterans, 76\% male, mean age 50.5 years. Depression severity and SI were assessed using the BDI-II. Experiential acceptance and mindfulness were measured with the Acceptance and Action Questionnaire-II (AAQ-II) and the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire, respectively. Results: Of the 981 patients, 647 (66.0\%) completed 10 or more sessions or finished early due to symptom relief. For Veterans with SI at baseline, mean BDI-II score decreased from 33.5 to 22.9. For Veterans with no SI at baseline, mean BDI-II score decreased from 26.3 to 15.9. Mixed models with repeated measurement indicated a significant reduction in depression severity from baseline to final assessment (b {$\frac{1}{4}$} \`A10.52, p {$<$} .001). After adjusting for experiential acceptance and mindfulness, patients with SI at baseline demonstrated significantly greater improvement in depression severity during ACT-D treatment, relative to patients with no SI at baseline (b {$\frac{1}{4}$} \`A2.81, p {$\frac{1}{4}$} .001). Furthermore, increases in experiential acceptance and mindfulness scores across time were associated with a reduction in depression severity across time (b {$\frac{1}{4}$} \`A0.44, p {$<$} .001 and b {$\frac{1}{4}$} \`A0.09, p {$<$} .001, respectfully), and the attenuating effect of mindfulness on depression severity increased across time (b {$\frac{1}{4}$} \`A0.05, p {$\frac{1}{4}$} .042). Increases in experiential acceptance scores across time were associated with lower odds of SI across time (odds ratio {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.97, 95\% CI [0.95, 0.99], p {$\frac{1}{4}$} .016) and the attenuating effect of experiential acceptance on SI increased across time (odds ratio {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.96, 95\% CI [0.92, 0.99], p {$\frac{1}{4}$} .023). Overall the number of patients with no SI increased from 44.5\% at baseline to 65\% at follow-up. Conclusions: Veterans receiving ACT-D demonstrated decreased depression severity and decreased odds of SI during treatment. Increases in experiential acceptance and mindfulness scores were associated with reduction in depression severity across time and increases in experiential acceptance scores were associated with reductions in SI across time.},

The present study was designed to address the issue of generalization by evaluating the outcome of a consecutive series of patients meeting diagnostic criteria for hypochondriasis, treated using CBT in a non-academic clinic in Copenhagen, Denmark. The delivery of the treatment was adapted to fit with the practice of the clinic, so that the later components of therapy were delivered in a group therapy setting. Therapists participated in a brief training course, which was subsequently supplemented by expert clinical and peer supervision. Patients received the same amount of treatment used in previous clinical trials. Results indicate that the degree of improvement obtained in this study was significant and compared well with those obtained in the previous trials. These results support the use of dissemination of new treatments using a specialist training model.},

Consistent with other populations, the rate of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) for college students has been reported at around 12\%.

This study examines outcomes using cognitive processing therapy (CPT) with a sample of n = 26 college students in a UCC setting. This study also examines therapist experience, length of degree and symptom severity on outcome. After completing training, n = 8 therapists completed CPT consultation and certification. Students who participated in individual CPT during this process were administered the PCL-5 and PHQ-9 at weekly sessions. A retrospective chart review was completed. PCL-5 and PHQ-9 scores were separately examined as outcome variables using linear mixed models where session, therapist experience, length of therapist degree, and severity of symptoms were included as fixed effects, and subjects were assumed to have a random effect. Significant reductions in PCL-5 and PHQ-9 scores were observed across treatment. In this sample, 84.6\% of students were treatment responders. Results were unchanged when adjusting for therapist level of experience or training. CPT shows strong potential for UCC settings. CPT can be successfully implemented with novice therapists.

The second study, using the CORE Outcome Measure and ratings of problem severity, found counselling to be equally effective with disadvantaged and non-disadvantaged clients, as defined by British Department of Health criteria, but these clients differed somewhat in their perceptions of helpful aspects of counselling. Both studies also indicated predictors of positive outcome of counselling. The studies are used to illustrate some of the methodological issues around research in this area.},

Results: There were significant improvements on all outcome measures with large effect sizes (Cohen's d ranging from 0.68 to 2.02). Improvement on PCS (Cohen's d = 1.21) was associated with lower levels of VA service-connected disability and PE treatment completion. Conclusion: PE treatment-related improvements for participants with comorbid PTSD and TBI generalize from PTSD outcomes to PCS and other TBI-related outcomes. Positive outcomes were independent of TBI severity, treatment setting, or Veteran status, but dependent upon PE treatment completion and lower levels of VA service-connected disability.},

  abstract = {Objective: Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) reduces fatigue and disability in chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). However, outcomes vary between studies, possibly because of differences in patient characteristics, treatment protocols, diagnostic criteria and outcome measures. The objective was to compare outcomes after CBT in tertiary treatment centres in the Netherlands (NL) and the United Kingdom (UK), using different treatment protocols but identical outcome measures, while controlling for differences in patient characteristics and diagnostic criteria.Methods: Consecutively referred CFS patients who received CBT were included (NL: n=293, UK: n=163). Uncontrolled effect sizes for improvement in fatigue (Chalder Fatigue Questionnaire), physical functioning (SF-36 physical functioning subscale) and social functioning (Work and Social Adjustment Scale) were compared. Multiple regression analysis was used to examine whether patient differences explained outcome differences between centres.Results: Effect sizes differed between centres for fatigue (Cohen's D NL=1.74, 95\% CI=1.52-1.95; UK=0.99, CI=0.73-1.25), physical functioning (NL=0.99, CI=0.81-1.18; UK=0.33, CI=0.08-0.58) and social functioning (NL=1.47, CI=1.26-1.69; UK=0.61, CI=0.35-0.86). Patients in the UK had worse physical functioning at baseline and there were minor demographic differences. These could not explain differences in centre outcome.Conclusion: Effectiveness of CBT differed between treatment centres. Differences in treatment protocols may explain this and should be investigated to help further improve outcomes.},

There were statistically significant reductions in depression (PHQ-9) and anxiety (GAD-7) associated with DIT, with medium and large effect sizes, respectively. Overall, 75\% of patients showed an improvement on the PHQ-9 and GAD-7 following DIT. When this was calculated as statistically reliable change, the improvements reduced to 42\% for anxiety and 25\% for depression. As this study was uncontrolled, the significance cannot be reliably attributed to DIT. Future research may aim to investigate DIT's effectiveness in different settings with a larger sample size, using appropriate comparison groups under controlled conditions.},

  abstract = {Background               Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) is a National Institute for Health and Care Excellence-approved approach to intervention for depression and/or anxiety. This exploratory study sets the groundwork for comparing psychological therapies for Deaf sign language users experiencing anxiety and/or depression, delivered in British Sign Language (BSL) by a Deaf therapist with usual access through an interpreter within the IAPT national programme.                                         Objectives               (1) To explore the following questions: (a) is BSL-IAPT more effective than standard IAPT for Deaf people with anxiety and/or depression? and (b) is any additional benefit from BSL-IAPT worth any additional cost to provide it? (2) To establish relevant BSL versions of assessment tools and methods to answer research questions (a) and (b). (3) To gauge the feasibility of a larger-scale definitive study and to inform its future design.                                         Design               A mixed-methods exploratory study combing an economic model to synthesise data from multiple sources; a qualitative study of understanding and acceptability of randomisation and trial terminology; statistical determination of clinical cut-off points of standardised assessments in BSL; secondary data analysis of anonymised IAPT client records; realist inquiry incorporating interviews with service providers and survey results.                                         Settings               IAPT service providers (NHS and private); the Deaf community.                                         Participants                                Deaf people who use BSL and who are clients of IAPT services (                 n                 \,=\,502); healthy Deaf volunteers (                 n                 \,=\,104); IAPT service providers (NHS and private) (                 n                 \,=\,118).                                                        Interventions               IAPT at steps 2 and 3.                                         Main outcome measures               Reliable recovery and reliable improvement defined by IAPT; Deaf community views on the acceptability of randomisation; BSL terminology for trial-related language; clinical cut-off measurements for the BSL versions of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 items (PHQ-9) and the Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7); a valid BSL version of the EuroQol-5 Dimensions five-level version (EQ-5D-5L); costs, quality-adjusted life-years and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios.                                         Data sources               IAPT service provider anonymised records of the characteristics and clinical outcomes of Deaf BSL users of BSL-IAPT and of standard IAPT; published literature.                                         Results               Randomisation may be acceptable to Deaf people who use IAPT if linguistic and cultural requirements are addressed. Specifications for effective information in BSL for recruitment have been established. A valid EQ-5D-5L in BSL has been produced. The clinical cut-off point for the GAD-7 BSL is 6 and for the PHQ-9 BSL is 8. No significant difference in rates of reliable recovery and reliable improvement between Deaf users of standard IAPT or BSL-IAPT has been found. Whether or not BSL-IAPT is more cost-effective than standard IAPT is uncertain.                                         Limitations               The small number of participating standard IAPT services who have seen Deaf clients means that there is statistical uncertainty in the comparable clinical outcome result. Clinical cut-off scores have not been verified through gold standard clinical interview methodology. Limited data availability means that whether or not BSL-IAPT is more cost-effective than standard IAPT is uncertain.                                         Conclusions               There is a lack of evidence to definitively compare reliable recovery and reliable improvement between Deaf users of standard IAPT and BSL-IAPT. Instrumentation and prerequisites for a larger-scale study have been established.                                         Future work               A prospective observational study for definitive results is justified.

  abstract = {Background: In major depression (MDD), hospital treatment is an option in more severe cases or if outpatient treatment failed. Psychosomatic hospitals in Germany provide treatment programs with multimodal psychotherapy, either in an inpatient or a day hospital setting. In the context of health care research, this study aimed (1) to compare characteristics of patients treated in psychosomatic day hospitals and inpatient units, (2) to compare the effectiveness of both treatment modalities.Methods: A naturalistic design was chosen to achieve external validity. 604 consecutive patients were assessed at admission, discharge and a 3-month follow-up. Primary outcome was defined as a reduction of depressive symptomatology (QIDS-C), secondary outcomes comprise overall functioning and quality of life. For a comparison of effectiveness, inpatient and day hospital samples were matched according to known predictors of outcome.Results: The few differences found between the inpatient and day hospital sample were related to severity of depression and physical impairment. Inpatients more often got antidepressant medication. Additionally, inpatients were treated significantly longer, due to a subgroup of patients with somatic co-morbidity. There were no differences when comparing effectiveness.Limitations: When comparing treatment effectiveness, possible bias cannot be ruled out. There was no randomization or untreated control group.Conclusions: In patients with a more severe depression and somatic co-morbidity, inpatient treatment might be preferred as compared to day hospital treatment. However, most patients can be treated in both settings.},

  abstract = {Dropout from psychotherapy is frequent and limits the benefits patients can receive from treatment. The study of factors associated with dropout has the potential to yield strategies to reduce it. This study analyzed data from a large sample of adults (N = 1,092) receiving naturalistic cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) to test the hypotheses that dropouts, as compared to completers, had (1) higher symptom severity at treatment termination, (2) a slower rate of symptom change during treatment, and (3) a higher odds that the therapist rated treatment as ending for reasons related to poor outcome. Results showed that although dropouts ended treatment with higher symptom severity than completers, dropouts and completers did not differ in their rate of symptom change during treatment, suggesting that dropouts had higher symptom severity at termination because they received fewer sessions of treatment, not because their symptoms changed at a slower rate. Dropout was also associated with a higher odds of having a therapist-rated termination reason indicating a poor outcome, suggesting that dropout is more likely if patients are dissatisfied with some aspect of the therapy outcome or process. These findings suggest that strategies for monitoring and enhancing patient satisfaction with the process and outcome of treatment may help patients stay in treatment longer and end treatment with fewer symptoms than if they had dropped out.},
