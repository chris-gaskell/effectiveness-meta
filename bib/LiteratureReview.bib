Attitudes toward treatment manuals are a potentially important determinant of how likely practitioners are to use manual-based treatments in clinical practice. A total of 891 practicing psychologists nationwide were surveyed about their attitudes toward treatment manuals and their ideas about the content of manuals. Practitioners held widely varying attitudes toward treatment manuals, and ideas about what constitutes a manual were associated with attitudes in a predictable way. Recommendations are made for how to gather more useful information about practitioners' attitudes toward the many changes affecting current models of clinical practice.

  abstract = {Objectives To test the inter-rater reliability of the RoB tool applied to Physical Therapy (PT) trials by comparing ratings from Cochrane review authors with those of blinded external reviewers. Methods Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in PT were identified by searching the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for meta-analysis of PT interventions. RoB assessments were conducted independently by 2 reviewers blinded to the RoB ratings reported in the Cochrane reviews. Data on RoB assessments from Cochrane reviews and other characteristics of reviews and trials were extracted. Consensus assessments between the two reviewers were then compared with the RoB ratings from the Cochrane reviews. Agreement between Cochrane and blinded external reviewers was assessed using weighted kappa ({$\kappa$}). Results In total, 109 trials included in 17 Cochrane reviews were assessed. Inter-rater reliability on the overall RoB assessment between Cochrane review authors and blinded external reviewers was poor ({$\kappa$} = 0.02, 95\%CI: -0.06, 0.06]). Inter-rater reliability on individual domains of the RoB tool was poor (median {$\kappa$} = 0.19), ranging from {$\kappa$} = -0.04 (``Other bias'') to {$\kappa$} = 0.62 (``Sequence generation''). There was also no agreement ({$\kappa$} = -0.29, 95\%CI: -0.81, 0.35]) in the overall RoB assessment at the meta-analysis level. Conclusions Risk of bias assessments of RCTs using the RoB tool are not consistent across different research groups. Poor agreement was not only demonstrated at the trial level but also at the meta-analysis level. Results have implications for decision making since different recommendations can be reached depending on the group analyzing the evidence. Improved guidelines to consistently apply the RoB tool and revisions to the tool for different health areas are needed.},

  abstract = {To better understand how to impute within-arm correlation for meta-analyses of continuous outcomes when data are missing, this study describes the range of correlation values in a representative set of studies with sufficient data reported, and simulates the effect of using different correlation values on meta-analysis summary estimates when imputing missing data., It is common that studies do not report sufficient data to allow meta-analysis of continuous outcomes. The standard error (SE) of the within-group differences is often not reported and cannot be calculated because the within-group correlation is unknown. For meta-analysis of net-changes, one must thus estimate the SE based on an arbitrarily chosen correlation., From articles available to us from previous systematic reviews and from trials registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, we selected those that prospectively compared two or more interventions for continuous outcomes and reported all three of: baseline means and SEs (or equivalent), final means and SEs, and within-group changes and SEs. From these data we back-calculated correlation values for each study group. We described these data and tested for patterns based on study characteristics. We assessed the bias on estimates of within-group change SEs by comparing reported SEs with imputed SEs using arbitrarily chosen correlation values. We simulated meta-analyses, assessing the bias, coverage, and accuracy of the summary estimates derived from studies with missing correlation data., We analyzed 811 within-group correlation values from 123 studies with 281 study groups. The median (interquartile range) within-group correlation values across all studies was 0.59 (0.40, 0.81). Active treatment groups had lower correlation values (median 0.54) than no treatment groups (median 0.73, P{$<$}0.001). There was heterogeneity of correlation values across both outcome types and clinical domains. There was no apparent association with followup duration, but correlation values were lower with increasing sample size among no treatment groups. In the empiric dataset, imputing low correlation values (0 or 0.25) yielded an overestimation of the within-group SE in more than 85 percent of cases; imputing a correlation of 0.5 yielded values closer to those actually reported. Imputation had similar effects on the net-change SE. Simulation studies informed by the empirical results, demonstrated that imputation of values does not introduce bias in the meta-analysis estimate. Imputing values higher than the true correlation resulted in coverage probabilities that were lower than those in analyses using the complete data. However, coverage probabilities were generally lower than nominal ({$<$}0.95 even with complete data) in the presence of moderate to substantial between study heterogeneity, despite using random effects models (DerSimonian-Laird)., Negative within-group correlation values are very uncommon in clinical studies. Imputing values in meta-analyses where some or all within-group correlation estimates are not reported does not introduce bias in the summary estimate of the treatment effect. However, imputation can affect the SE of the summary estimate when the imputed value is different from the ``true.'' In such cases, sensitivity analyses using alternative imputation values, possibly informed by studies reporting relevant information, are recommended.},

Basic quality improvement in outcomes for a single service is considered. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {Background: Previous meta-analyses comparing the efficacy of psychotherapeutic interventions for depression were clouded by a limited number of within-study treatment comparisons. This study used network meta-analysis, a novel methodological approach that integrates direct and indirect evidence from randomised controlled studies, to re-examine the comparative efficacy of seven psychotherapeutic interventions for adult depression. Methods and Findings: We conducted systematic literature searches in PubMed, PsycINFO, and Embase up to November 2012, and identified additional studies through earlier meta-analyses and the references of included studies. We identified 198 studies, including 15,118 adult patients with depression, and coded moderator variables. Each of the seven psychotherapeutic interventions was superior to a waitlist control condition with moderate to large effects (range d = 20.62 to d = 20.92). Relative effects of different psychotherapeutic interventions on depressive symptoms were absent to small (range d = 0.01 to d = 20.30). Interpersonal therapy was significantly more effective than supportive therapy (d = 20.30, 95\% credibility interval [CrI] [20.54 to 20.05]). Moderator analysis showed that patient characteristics had no influence on treatment effects, but identified aspects of study quality and sample size as effect modifiers. Smaller effects were found in studies of at least moderate (Dd = 0.29 [20.01 to 0.58]; p = 0.063) and large size (Dd = 0.33 [0.08 to 0.61]; p = 0.012) and those that had adequate outcome assessment (Dd = 0.38 [20.06 to 0.87]; p = 0.100). Stepwise restriction of analyses by sample size showed robust effects for cognitive-behavioural therapy, interpersonal therapy, and problem-solving therapy (all d.0.46) compared to waitlist. Empirical evidence from large studies was unavailable or limited for other psychotherapeutic interventions. Conclusions: Overall our results are consistent with the notion that different psychotherapeutic interventions for depression have comparable benefits. However, the robustness of the evidence varies considerably between different psychotherapeutic treatments.},

The test statistic is a direct statistical analogue of the popular "funnel-graph." The number of component studies in the meta-analysis, the nature of the selection mechanism, the range of variances of the effect size estimates, and the true underlying effect size are all observed to be influential in determining the power of the test. The test is fairly powerful for large meta-analyses with 75 component studies, but has only moderate power for meta-analyses with 25 component studies. However, in many of the configurations in which there is low power, there is also relatively little bias in the summary effect size estimate. Nonetheless, the test must be interpreted with caution in small meta-analyses. In particular, bias cannot be ruled out if the test is not significant. The proposed technique has potential utility as an exploratory tool for meta-analysts, as a formal procedure to complement the funnel-graph.},

While large-scale studies often employ subgroup analyses, these analyses cannot generally be performed for small-scale studies, since these typically include a homogeneous population and only one variant of the intervention. This limitation can be bypassed by using meta-analysis. Meta-analysis allows the researcher to compare the treatment effect in different subgroups, even if these subgroups appear in separate studies. We discuss several statistical issues related to this procedure, including the selection of a statistical model and statistical power for the comparison. To illustrate these points, we use the example of a meta-analysis of obesity prevention.},

METHODS: Electronic and manual searches were carried out up to and including 2008. Studies were screened for content relevance and selected according to specified inclusion criteria. Data were extracted from all studies that met criteria and were quality assessed using an adapted version of a checklist designed for the appraisal of both randomized and non-randomized studies of health care interventions. Studies were synthesized according to (1) the type of problem being treated and (2) study design using descriptive and meta-analytic methods where appropriate. RESULTS: Psychological treatment conducted in routine clinic settings is effective for a range of client problems, particularly common mental health problems (uncontrolled effect size = 1.29; 95\% CI = 1.26-1.33, N = 10,842). When benchmarked against data from efficacy studies, practice-based studies yielded effect sizes that fell short of the selected benchmark. In contrast, the practice-based studies achieved the benchmark for percentage of clients meeting a stringent criterion for recovery. CONCLUSIONS: Clients receiving treatment as normally delivered within routine practice report significant relief of symptoms. However, the result of comparisons with efficacy benchmarks is dependent on the outcome index used. Notwithstanding this, substantive factors are also likely to contribute. Therefore, in addition to attending to methodological issues, further work is required to understand the relative contribution of these factors.},

  abstract = {Purpose. This study reviews the quality of the extant outcome evidence for Cognitive Analytic Therapy (CAT) in order to inform decisions of when to use the model with patients and to stimulate a future CAT research strategy. Method. An electronic search identified CAT efficacy and effectiveness studies and these were subject to systematic review. The methodological quality of studies meeting inclusion criteria were appraised using two validated research study quality checklists and studies were fitted to an established model of psychotherapy evaluation. Results. Twenty-five outcome studies met the inclusion criteria, including five randomised controlled trials. The CAT evidence-base is predominated by smallscale practice-based studies, in typically complex and severe clinical populations 44\% were focal to the treatment of personality disorder. Whilst the quality of extant CAT evidence is generally sound (52\% of studies were high quality), the depth and breadth of the evidence-base is currently limited. Where comparisons with other modalities were available, CAT appeared largely equivocal. Conclusions. CAT is a popular and promising intervention for complex presentations. However, the evidence-base currently lacks wider credibility due to having largely bypassed the rigors of the controlled phase of the hourglass model of psychotherapy evaluation. There is a particular need for further CAT outcome research with common mental health problems. Practitioner points  CAT can be an effective intervention across a range of mental health difficulties  Consider a 24 session CAT contract for those patients presenting with complex and severe difficulties},

We included 41 studies that randomly assigned patients (N = 2,835) with acute stress disorder, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), panic disorder (PD), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or social anxiety disorder (SAD) to CBT or a psychological or pill placebo condition. Findings demonstrated moderate placebo-controlled effects of CBT on target disorder symptoms (Hedges' g = 0.56), and small to moderate effects on other anxiety symptoms (Hedges' g = 0.38), depression (Hedges' g = 0.31) and quality of life (Hedges' g = 0.30). Response rates in CBT compared to placebo were associated with an odds ratio of 2.97. Effects on the target disorder were significantly stronger for completer samples than intent-to-treat samples, and for individual compared to group CBT in SAD and PTSD studies. Large effect sizes were found for OCD, GAD and acute stress disorder, and small to moderate effect sizes were found for PTSD, SAD and PD. In PTSD studies, dropout rates were greater in CBT (29.0\%) compared to placebo (17.2\%), but no difference in dropout was found across other disorders. Interventions primarily using exposure strategies had larger effect sizes than those using cognitive or cognitive and behavioral techniques, though this difference did not reach significance. Findings demonstrate that CBT is a moderately efficacious treatment for anxiety disorders when compared to placebo. More effective treatments are especially needed for PTSD, SAD and PD.},

  abstract = {Background Internationally, the clinical outcomes of routine mental health services are rarely recorded or reported; however, an exception is the English Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) service, which delivers psychological therapies recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence for depression and anxiety disorders to more than 537\hphantom{,}000 patients in the UK each year. A session-by-session outcome monitoring system ensures that IAPT obtains symptom scores before and after treatment for 98\% of patients. Service outcomes can then be reported, along with contextual information, on public websites. Methods We used publicly available data to identify predictors of variability in clinical performance. Using {$\beta$} regression models, we analysed the outcome data released by National Health Service Digital and Public Health England for the 2014\textendash 15 financial year (April 1, 2014, to March 31, 2015) and developed a predictive model of reliable improvement and reliable recovery. We then tested whether these predictors were also associated with changes in service outcome between 2014\textendash 15 and 2015\textendash 16. Findings Five service organisation features predicted clinical outcomes in 2014\textendash 15. Percentage of cases with a problem descriptor, number of treatment sessions, and percentage of referrals treated were positively associated with outcome. The time waited to start treatment and percentage of appointments missed were negatively associated with outcome. Additive odd ratios suggest that moving from the lowest to highest level on an organisational factor could improve service outcomes by 11\textendash 42\%, dependent on the factor. Consistent with a causal model, most organisational factors also predicted between-year changes in outcome, together accounting for 33\% of variance in reliable improvement and 22\% for reliable recovery. Social deprivation was negatively associated with some outcomes, but the effect was partly mitigated by the organisational factors. Interpretation Traditionally, efforts to improve mental health outcomes have largely focused on the development of new and more effective treatments. Our analyses show that the way psychological therapy services are implemented could be similarly important. Mental health services elsewhere in the UK and in other countries might benefit from adopting IAPT's approach to recording and publicly reporting clinical outcomes. Funding Wellcome Trust.},

The results of a meta-analysis investigating how effective psychological treatment is for depressed inpatients are presented. A systematic search in bibliographical databases resulted in 12 studies with a total of 570 respondents. This set of studies had sufficient statistical power to detect small effect sizes. Psychological treatments had a small (g = 0.29), but statistically significant additional effect on depression compared to usual care and structured pharmacological treatments only. This corresponded with a numbersneeded-to-be-treated of 6.17. Heterogeneity was zero in most analyses, and not significant in all analyses. There was no indication for significant publication bias. Effects were not associated with characteristics of the population, the interventions and the design of the studies.

Methods: To fill this gap in knowledge, the present metaregression analysis examined the association between the effects of psychotherapy for adult depression and several indicators of amount, frequency and intensity of therapy. The analysis included 70 studies (92 comparisons) with 5403 patients, in which individual psychotherapy was compared with a control group (e.g. waiting list, care-as-usual). Results: There was only a small association between number of therapy sessions and effect size, and this association was no longer significant when the analysis adjusted for other characteristics of the studies. The multivariable analyses also found no significant association with the total contact time or duration of the therapy. However, there was a strong association between number of sessions per week and effect size.

The present article integrates this new evidence with the older literature through a quantitative meta-analysis. A total of 41 studies (with 2132 patients meeting diagnostic criteria for GAD) were identified through systematic searches in bibliographical databases, and were included in the meta-analysis. Most studies examined the effects of cognitive behavior therapy (CBT). The majority of studies used waiting lists as control condition. The pooled effect of the 38 comparisons (from 28 studies) of psychotherapy versus a control group was large (g=0.84; 95\% CI: 0.71\textendash 0.97) with low to moderate heterogeneity. The effects based on self-report measures were somewhat lower than those based on clinician-rated instruments. The effects on depression were also large (g=0.71; 95\% CI: 0.59\textendash 0.82). There were some indications for publication bias. The number of studies comparing CBT with other psychotherapies (e.g., applied relaxation) or pharmacotherapy was too small to draw conclusions about comparative effectiveness or the long-term effects. There were some indications that CBT was also effective at follow-up and that CBT was more effective than applied relaxation in the longer term.},

  abstract = {Background. The effects of antidepressants for treating depressive disorders have been overestimated because of selective publication of positive trials. Reanalyses that include unpublished trials have yielded reduced effect sizes. This in turn has led to claims that antidepressants have clinically insignificant advantages over placebo and that psychotherapy is therefore a better alternative. To test this, we conducted a meta-analysis of studies comparing psychotherapy with pill placebo. Method. Ten 10 studies comparing psychotherapies with pill placebo were identified. In total, 1240 patients were included in these studies. For each study, Hedges' g was calculated. Characteristics of the studies were extracted for subgroup and meta-regression analyses. Results. The effect of psychotherapy compared to pill placebo at post-test was g = 0.25 [95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.14\textendash 0.36, I 2 = 0\%, 95\% CI 0\textendash 58]. This effect size corresponds to a number needed to treat (NNT) of 7.14 (95\% CI 5.00\textendash 12.82). The psychotherapy conditions scored 2.66 points lower on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) than the placebo conditions, and 3.20 points lower on the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Some indications for publication bias were found (two missing studies). We found no significant differences between subgroups of the studies and in meta-regression analyses we found no significant association between baseline severity and effect size. Conclusions. Although there are differences between the role of placebo in psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy research, psychotherapy has an effect size that is comparable to that of antidepressant medications. Whether these effects should be deemed clinically relevant remains open to debate.},

  abstract = {Aims The standardised mean difference (SMD) is one of the most used effect sizes to indicate the effects of treatments. It indicates the difference between a treatment and comparison group after treatment has ended, in terms of standard deviations. Some meta-analyses, including several highly cited and influential ones, use the pre-post SMD, indicating the difference between baseline and post-test within one (treatment group). METHODS: In this paper, we argue that these pre-post SMDs should be avoided in meta-analyses and we describe the arguments why pre-post SMDs can result in biased outcomes. RESULTS: One important reason why pre-post SMDs should be avoided is that the scores on baseline and post-test are not independent of each other. The value for the correlation should be used in the calculation of the SMD, while this value is typically not known. We used data from an 'individual patient data' meta-analysis of trials comparing cognitive behaviour therapy and anti-depressive medication, to show that this problem can lead to considerable errors in the estimation of the SMDs. Another even more important reason why pre-post SMDs should be avoided in meta-analyses is that they are influenced by natural processes and characteristics of the patients and settings, and these cannot be discerned from the effects of the intervention. Between-group SMDs are much better because they control for such variables and these variables only affect the between group SMD when they are related to the effects of the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that pre-post SMDs should be avoided in meta-analyses as using them probably results in biased outcomes.},

Method: In this meta-analysis we examined the effects of 15 different types of psychotherapy using 385 comparisons between a therapy and a control condition: Acceptance and commitment therapy, mindfulness-based cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), guided self-help using a self-help book from David Burns, Beck's CBT, the ``Coping with Depression'' course, two subtypes of behavioral activation, extended and brief problem-solving therapy, self-examination therapy, brief psychodynamic therapy, non-directive counseling, full and brief interpersonal psychotherapy, and life review therapy. Results: The effect sizes ranged from g = 0.38 for the ``Coping with Depression'' course to g = 1.10 for life review therapy. There was significant publication bias for most therapies. In 70\% of the trials there was at least some risk of bias. After adjusting studies with low risk of bias for publication bias, only two types of therapy remained significant (the ``Coping with Depression'' course, and self-examination therapy). Conclusions: We conclude that the 15 types of psychotherapy may be effective in the treatment of depression. However, the evidence is not conclusive because of high levels of heterogeneity, publication bias, and the risk of bias in the majority of studies.},

Effects of feedback on dropout rate, percentage of deteriorated cases, and treatment duration were also exam\- ined. Moderation analyses were conducted for study and feedback characteristics. A small significant effect of progress feedback on symptom reduction (d = 0.15, 95\% CI: [0.10, 0.20]) was found, compared to control groups. This was also true for not-on-track cases (d = 0.17, 95\% CI: [0.11, 0.22]). In addition, feedback had a small favorable effect on dropout rates (OR = 1.19, 95\% CI: [1.03, 1.38]). The moderation analyses identified several potentially interesting variables for further research, including feedback instrument, outcome instrument, type of feedback, feedback frequency, treatment intensity, and country in which the study was conducted. Future studies should report on these variables more consistently so that we can obtain a better understanding of when and why feedback improves outcomes.},

  abstract = {Background: Policy developments in recent years have led to important changes in the level of access to evidence-based psychological treatments. Several methods have been used to investigate the effectiveness of these treatments in routine care, with different approaches to outcome definition and data analysis. Aims: To present a review of challenges and methods for the evaluation of evidence-based treatments delivered in routine mental healthcare. This is followed by a case example of a benchmarking method applied in primary care. Method: High, average and poor performance benchmarks were calculated through a meta-analysis of published data from services working under the Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) Programme in England. Pre-post treatment effect sizes (ES) and confidence intervals were estimated to illustrate a benchmarking method enabling services to evaluate routine clinical outcomes. Results: High, average and poor performance ES for routine IAPT services were estimated to be 0.91, 0.73 and 0.46 for depression (using PHQ-9) and 1.02, 0.78 and 0.52 for anxiety (using GAD-7). Data from one specific IAPT service exemplify how to evaluate and contextualize routine clinical performance against these benchmarks. Conclusions: The main contribution of this report is to summarize key recommendations for the selection of an adequate set of psychometric measures, the operational definition of outcomes, and the statistical evaluation of clinical performance. A benchmarking method is also presented, which may enable a robust evaluation of clinical performance against national benchmarks. Some limitations concerned significant heterogeneity among data sources, and wide variations in ES and data completeness.},

  abstract = {Objective: It is widely believed that psychological treatment has little effect on more severely depressed patients. This study assessed whether pretreatment severity moderates psychological treatment outcome relative to controls by means of meta-analyses. Method: We included 132 studies (10,134 participants) from a database of studies (www.evidencebasedpsychotherapies.org) in which the effects of psychological treatment on adult outpatients with a depressive disorder or an elevated level of depressive symptoms were compared with a control condition in a randomized controlled trial. Two raters independently extracted outcome data and rated study characteristics. We conducted metaregression analyses assessing whether mean pretreatment depression scores predicted psychological treatment versus control condition posttreatment effect size and subgroup analyses summarizing the results of studies reporting within-study analyses of depression severity and psychological treatment outcome. Results: Psychological treatment was found to be consistently superior to control conditions (d ϭ 0.40 \textendash{} 0.88). We found no indication that pretreatment mean depression scores predicted psychological treatment versus control condition posttreatment effect size, even after adjusting for relevant study characteristics. However, among the smaller subset of studies that reported within-study severity analyses, posttreatment effect sizes were higher for high-severity patients (d ϭ 0.63) than for low-severity patients (d ϭ 0.22) when psychological treatment was efficacious relative to a more stringent control. Conclusion: Contrary to conventional wisdom, our findings suggest that when compared with control conditions, psychological treatment might be more efficacious for high-severity than for low-severity patients. Because the number of studies reporting within-study severity analyses is small, we recommend that future studies routinely report tests for Severity ϫ Treatment interactions.},

We examined whether a simple test of asymmetry of funnel plots predicts discordance of results when meta-analyses are compared to large trials, and we assessed the prevalence of bias in published meta-analyses. Design: Medline search to identify pairs consisting of a meta-analysis and a single large trial (concordance of results was assumed if effects were in the same direction and the meta-analytic estimate was within 30\% of the trial); analysis of funnel plots from 37 meta-analyses identified from a hand search of four leading general medicine journals 1993-6 and 38 meta-analyses from the second 1996 issue of the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Main outcome measure: Degree of funnel plot asymmetry as measured by the intercept from regression of standard normal deviates against precision. Results: In the eight pairs of meta-analysis and large trial that were identified (five from cardiovascular medicine, one from diabetic medicine, one from geriatric medicine, one from perinatal medicine) there were four concordant and four discordant pairs. In all cases discordance was due to meta-analyses showing larger effects. Funnel plot asymmetry was present in three out of four discordant pairs but in none of concordant pairs. In 14 (38\%) journal meta-analyses and 5 (13\%) Cochrane reviews, funnel plot asymmetry indicated that there was bias. Conclusions: A simple analysis of funnel plots provides a useful test for the likely presence of bias in meta-analyses, but as the capacity to detect bias will be limited when meta-analyses are based on a limited number of small trials the results from such analyses should be treated with considerable caution. Key messages Systematic reviews of randomised trials are the best strategy for appraising evidence; however, the findings of some meta-analyses were later contradicted by large trialsFunnel plots, plots of the trials' effect estimates against sample size, are skewed and asymmetrical in the presence of publication bias and other biasesFunnel plot asymmetry, measured by regression analysis, predicts discordance of results when meta-analyses are compared with single large trialsFunnel plot asymmetry was found in 38\% of meta-analyses published in leading general medicine journals and in 13\% of reviews from the Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsCritical examination of systematic reviews for publication and related biases should be considered a routine procedure},

However, recent reviews suggest that therapist effects may vary as a function of the context in which care is provided and therefore should not be generalized beyond that context. This study statistically analysed therapist effect differences between care sectors delivering psychological interventions. The sample comprised routine clinical data from 26,814 patients (69\% female; mean age 38) and 466 therapists in five care sectors: primary care, secondary care, university, voluntary, and workplace. Therapist effects were analysed using multilevel models and Markov chain Monte Carlo credible intervals. The therapist effect was significantly larger in primary care (8.4\%) than in any other sector (1.1\%\textendash 2.3\%) except secondary care (4.1\%), after controlling for explanatory baseline and process variables as well as accounting for differences between clinics. There were no other significant differences detected between care sectors. These findings support the hypothesis that differences in effectiveness between therapists vary depending on the context in which psychological treatment is provided. Differences in relative therapist impact can vary by a factor of 4\textendash 8 across treatment sectors. This should be considered in the application of research evidence, treatment planning, and the design and delivery of psychological care provision.},

Aims To synthesise evidence regarding the influence of initial severity on efficacy of CBT from all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in which CBT, in face-to-face individual or group format, was compared with pill-placebo control in adults with major depression. Method A systematic review and an individual-participant data meta-analysis using mixed models that included trial effects as random effects. We used multiple imputation to handle missing data. Results We identified five RCTs, and we were given access to individual-level data (n = 509) for all five. The analyses revealed that the difference in changes in Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression between CBT and pill placebo was not influenced by baseline severity (interaction P = 0.43). Removing the non-significant interaction term from the model, the difference between CBT and pill placebo was a standardised mean difference of 70.22 (95\% CI 70.42 to 70.02, P = 0.03, I2 = 0\%). much benefit from CBT across the wide range of baseline severity.

Given the expanding application and importance of literature synthesis, understanding both its strengths and weaknesses is essential for its practitioners and consumers. This volume is a good beginning for those who wish to gain that understanding." \textemdash Chance "Meta-analysis, as the statistical analysis of a large collection of results from individual studies is called, has now achieved a status of respectability in medicine. This respectability, when combined with the slight hint of mystique that sometimes surrounds meta-analysis, ensures that results of studies that use it are treated with the respect they deserve....The Handbook of Research Synthesis is one of the most important publications in this subject both as a definitive reference book and a practical manual."\textemdash British Medical Journal When the first edition of The Handbook of Research Synthesis was published in 1994, it quickly became the definitive reference for researchers conducting meta-analyses of existing research in both the social and biological sciences. In this fully revised second edition, editors Harris Cooper, Larry Hedges, and Jeff Valentine present updated versions of the Handbook's classic chapters, as well as entirely new sections reporting on the most recent, cutting-edge developments in the field. Research synthesis is the practice of systematically distilling and integrating data from a variety of sources in order to draw more reliable conclusions about a given question or topic. The Handbook of Research Synthesis and Meta-Analysis draws upon years of groundbreaking advances that have transformed research synthesis from a narrative craft into an important scientific process in its own right. Cooper, Hedges, and Valentine have assembled leading authorities in the field to guide the reader through every stage of the research synthesis process\textemdash problem formulation, literature search and evaluation, statistical integration, and report preparation. The Handbook of Research Synthesis and Meta-Analysis incorporates state-of-the-art techniques from all quantitative synthesis traditions. Distilling a vast technical literature and many informal sources, the Handbook provides a portfolio of the most effective solutions to the problems of quantitative data integration. Among the statistical issues addressed by the authors are the synthesis of non-independent data sets, fixed and random effects methods, the performance of sensitivity analyses and model assessments, and the problem of missing data. The Handbook of Research Synthesis and Meta-Analysis also provides a rich treatment of the non-statistical aspects of research synthesis. Topics include searching the literature, and developing schemes for gathering information from study reports. Those engaged in research synthesis will also find useful advice on how tables, graphs, and narration can be used to provide the most meaningful communication of the results of research synthesis. In addition, the editors address the potentials and limitations of research synthesis, and its future directions. The past decade has been a period of enormous growth in the field of research synthesis. The second edition Handbook thoroughly revises original chapters to assure that the volume remains the most authoritative source of information for researchers undertaking meta-analysis today. In response to the increasing use of research synthesis in the formation of public policy, the second edition includes a new chapter on both the strengths and limitations of research synthesis in policy debates},

  abstract = {Background: The English Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) initiative aims to make evidence-based psychological therapies for depression and anxiety disorder more widely available in the National Health Service (NHS). 32 IAPT services based on a stepped care model were established in the first year of the programme. We report on the reliable recovery rates achieved by patients treated in the services and identify predictors of recovery at patient level, service level, and as a function of compliance with National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) Treatment Guidelines. Method: Data from 19,395 patients who were clinical cases at intake, attended at least two sessions, had at least two outcomes scores and had completed their treatment during the period were analysed. Outcome was assessed with the patient health questionnaire depression scale (PHQ-9) and the anxiety scale (GAD-7). Results: Data completeness was high for a routine cohort study. Over 91\% of treated patients had paired (pre-post) outcome scores. Overall, 40.3\% of patients were reliably recovered at post-treatment, 63.7\% showed reliable improvement and 6.6\% showed reliable deterioration. Most patients received treatments that were recommended by NICE. When a treatment not recommended by NICE was provided, recovery rates were reduced. Service characteristics that predicted higher reliable recovery rates were: high average number of therapy sessions; higher step-up rates among individuals who started with low intensity treatment; larger services; and a larger proportion of experienced staff. Conclusions: Compliance with the IAPT clinical model is associated with enhanced rates of reliable recovery. \'O 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd. Open access under CC BY-NC-ND license.},

This extent may be measured by estimating a between-study variance, but interpretation is then specific to a particular treatment effect metric. A test for the existence of heterogeneity exists, but depends on the number of studies in the meta-analysis. We develop measures of the impact of heterogeneity on a meta-analysis, from mathematical criteria, that are independent of the number of studies and the treatment effect metric. We derive and propose three suitable statistics: H is the square root of the {$\chi$}2 heterogeneity statistic divided by its degrees of freedom; R is the ratio of the standard error of the underlying mean from a random effects meta-analysis to the standard error of a fixed effect meta-analytic estimate, and I2 is a transformation of H that describes the proportion of total variation in study estimates that is due to heterogeneity. We discuss interpretation, interval estimates and other properties of these measures and examine them in five example data sets showing different amounts of heterogeneity. We conclude that H and I2, which can usually be calculated for published meta-analyses, are particularly useful summaries of the impact of heterogeneity. One or both should be presented in published meta-analyses in preference to the test for heterogeneity. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2002 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

What does this new quantity mean, and why is assessment of heterogeneity so important to clinical practice?  Systematic reviews and meta-analyses can provide convincing and reliable evidence relevant to many aspects of medicine and health care.1 Their value is especially clear when the results of the studies they include show clinically important effects of similar magnitude. However, the conclusions are less clear when the included studies have differing results. In an attempt to establish whether studies are consistent, reports of meta-analyses commonly present a statistical test of heterogeneity. The test seeks to determine whether there are genuine differences underlying the results of the studies (heterogeneity), or whether the variation in findings is compatible with chance alone (homogeneity). However, the test is susceptible to the number of trials included in the meta-analysis. We have developed a new quantity, I 2, which we believe gives a better measure of the consistency between trials in a meta-analysis. Assessment of the consistency of effects across studies is an essential part of meta-analysis. Unless we know how consistent the results of studies are, we cannot determine the generalisability of the findings of the meta-analysis. Indeed, several hierarchical systems for grading evidence state that the results of studies must be consistent or homogeneous to obtain the highest grading.2\textendash 4 Tests for heterogeneity are commonly used to decide on methods for combining studies and for concluding consistency or inconsistency of findings.5 6 But what does the test achieve in practice, and how should the resulting P values be interpreted? A test for heterogeneity examines the null hypothesis that all studies are evaluating the same effect. The usual test statistic \ldots},

The effect of treatment is normally quantified as a standardized mean difference (SMD). We describe procedures for computing unbiased estimates of the population SMD from sample data (e.g., group Ms and SDs), and provide guidance about a number of complications that may arise related to effect size computation. These complications include (a) incomplete data in research reports; (b) use of baseline data in computing SMDs and estimating the population standard deviation ({$\sigma$}); (c) combining effect size data from studies using different research designs; and (d) appropriate techniques for analysis of data from studies providing multiple estimates of the effect of interest (i.e., dependent effect sizes).Clinical or Methodological Significance of this article: Meta-analysis is a set of techniques for producing valid summaries of existing research.

That threshold is used to determine the necessary sample size for the proposed RCT. Once the RCT is done, the data generated are used to estimate the true effect size and its confidence interval. Clinical significance is assessed by comparing the true effect size to the threshold effect size. In subsequent meta-analysis, this effect size is combined with others, ultimately to determine whether treatment (T) is clinically significantly better than control (C). Thus, effect sizes play an important role both in designing RCTs and in interpreting their results; but specifically which effect size? We review the principles of statistical significance, power, and meta-analysis, and commonly used effect sizes. The commonly used effect sizes are limited in conveying clinical significance. We recommend three equivalent effect sizes: number needed to treat, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve comparing T and C responses, and success rate difference, chosen specifically to convey clinical significance.},

In response to the need for valid measures of psychotherapy outcome in routine practice, Lambert and associates developed the Outcome Questionnaire-45 (OQ-45; Lambert, Hansen, et al. 1996), a 45-item self-report instrument that requires patients to rate their functioning on a 5-point Likert scale. The OQ-45 was designed to access common symptoms across a wide range of adult mental disorders and syndromes, including stress-related illness. In addition, the OQ-45 was designed to be used as a baseline screening instrument with application in primary care for alerting physicians to the need for referral for psychological interventions. However, it was not developed for use as a diagnostic tool. Diagnosis is a task better served by traditional diagnostic practices, including the use of more appropriate instruments, such as the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI; Lambert, Burlingame, et al., 1996).

Previous systematic reviews have grouped theoretically similar interventions to determine differences between broadly distinct approaches. Consequently, we know little regarding the relative efficacy of the specific manualized therapies commonly applied to the treatment of PTSD.Objective: To determine the effect sizes of manualized therapies for PTSD.Methods: We undertook a systematic review following Cochrane Collaboration guidelines. A pre-determined definition of clinical importance was applied to the results and the quality of evidence was appraised using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) approach.Results: 114 randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) of 8171 participants were included. There was robust evidence that the therapies broadly defined as CBT with a trauma focus (CBT-T), as well as Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR), had a clinically important effect. The manualized CBT-Ts with the strongest evidence of effect were Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT); Cognitive Therapy (CT); and Prolonged Exposure (PE). There was also some evidence supporting CBT without a trauma focus; group CBT with a trauma focus; guided internet-based CBT; and Present Centred Therapy (PCT). There was emerging evidence for a number of other therapies.Conclusions: A recent increase in RCTs of psychological therapies for PTSD, results in a more confident recommendation of CBT-T and EMDR as the first-line treatments. Among the CBT-Ts considered by the review CPT, CT and PE should be the treatments of choice. The findings should guide evidence informed shared decision-making between patient and clinician.},

  abstract = {In meta-analysis, heterogeneity often exists between studies. Knowledge about study features (i.e., moderators) that can explain the heterogeneity in effect sizes can be useful for researchers to assess the effectiveness of existing interventions and design new potentially effective interventions. When there are multiple moderators, they may amplify or attenuate each other's effect on treatment effectiveness. However, in most meta-analysis studies, interaction effects are neglected due to the lack of appropriate methods. The method meta-CART was recently proposed to identify interactions between multiple moderators. The analysis result is a tree model in which the studies are partitioned into more homogeneous subgroups by combinations of moderators. This paper describes the R-package metacart, which provides user-friendly functions to conduct meta-CART analyses in R. This package can fit both fixed- and random-effects meta-CART, and can handle dichotomous, categorical, ordinal and continuous moderators. In addition, a new look ahead procedure is presented. The application of the package is illustrated step-by-step using diverse examples.},

Seventy-nine trials were included. Results: Therapist-led CBT was more efficacious than inactive (wait-lists) and active (any psychotherapy) comparisons in individuals with bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder. Therapist-led CBT was most efficacious when manualized CBT-BN or its enhanced version was delivered. No significant differences were observed between therapist-led CBT for bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder and antidepressants at posttreatment. CBT was also directly compared to other specific psychological interventions, and therapist-led CBT resulted in greater reductions in behavioral and cognitive symptoms than interpersonal psychotherapy at posttreatment. At follow-up, CBT outperformed interpersonal psychotherapy only on cognitive symptoms. CBT for binge eating disorder also resulted in greater reductions in behavioral symptoms than behavioral weight loss interventions. There was no evidence that CBT was more efficacious than behavior therapy or nonspecific supportive therapies. Conclusions: CBT is efficacious for eating disorders. Although CBT was equally efficacious to certain psychological treatments, the fact that CBT outperformed all active psychological comparisons and interpersonal psychotherapy specifically, offers some support for the specificity of psychological treatments for eating disorders. Conclusions from this study are hampered by the fact that many trials were of poor quality. Higher quality RCTs are essential. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

This study investigated whether for CBT similar effects can be expected under routine care conditions when the patients are comparable to those examined in RCTs. Method N=574 CBT patients from an outpatient clinic were stepwise matched to the patients undergoing CBT in the National Institute of Mental Health Treatment of Depression Collaborative Research Program (TDCRP). First, the exclusion criteria of the RCT were applied to the naturalistic sample of the outpatient clinic. Second, propensity score matching (PSM) was used to adjust the remaining naturalistic sample on the basis of baseline covariate distributions. Matched samples were then compared regarding treatment effects using effect sizes, average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) and recovery rates. Results CBT in the adjusted naturalistic subsample was as effective as in the RCT. However, treatments lasted significantly longer under routine care conditions. Limitations The samples included only a limited amount of common predictor variables and stemmed from different countries. There might be additional covariates, which could potentially further improve the matching between the samples. Conclusions CBT for depression in clinical practice might be equally effective as manual-based treatments in RCTs when they are applied to comparable patients. The fact that similar effects under routine conditions were reached with more sessions, however, points to the potential to optimize treatments in clinical practice with respect to their efficiency.},

We aimed to compare these interventions and to identify which are most effective for the acute treatment of social anxiety disorder in adults. Methods We did a systematic review and network meta-analysis of interventions for adults with social anxiety disorder, identified from published and unpublished sources between 1988 and Sept 13, 2013. We analysed interventions by class and individually. Outcomes were validated measures of social anxiety, reported as standardised mean differences (SMDs) compared with a waitlist reference. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42012003146. Findings We included 101 trials (13\hphantom{,}164 participants) of 41 interventions or control conditions (17 classes) in the analyses. Classes of pharmacological interventions that had greater effects on outcomes compared with waitlist were monoamine oxidase inhibitors (SMD -1{$\cdot$}01, 95\% credible interval [CrI] -1{$\cdot$}56 to -0{$\cdot$}45), benzodiazepines (-0{$\cdot$}96, -1{$\cdot$}56 to -0{$\cdot$}36), selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors and serotonin\textendash norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs and SNRIs; -0{$\cdot$}91, -1{$\cdot$}23 to -0{$\cdot$}60), and anticonvulsants (-0{$\cdot$}81, -1{$\cdot$}36 to -0{$\cdot$}28). Compared with waitlist, efficacious classes of psychological interventions were individual cognitive\textendash behavioural therapy (CBT; SMD -1{$\cdot$}19, 95\% CrI -1{$\cdot$}56 to -0{$\cdot$}81), group CBT (-0{$\cdot$}92, -1{$\cdot$}33 to -0{$\cdot$}51), exposure and social skills (-0{$\cdot$}86, -1{$\cdot$}42 to -0{$\cdot$}29), self-help with support (-0{$\cdot$}86, -1{$\cdot$}36 to -0{$\cdot$}36), self-help without support (-0{$\cdot$}75, -1{$\cdot$}25 to -0{$\cdot$}26), and psychodynamic psychotherapy (-0{$\cdot$}62, -0{$\cdot$}93 to -0{$\cdot$}31). Individual CBT compared with psychological placebo (SMD -0{$\cdot$}56, 95\% CrI -1{$\cdot$}00 to -0{$\cdot$}11), and SSRIs and SNRIs compared with pill placebo (-0{$\cdot$}44, -0{$\cdot$}67 to -0{$\cdot$}22) were the only classes of interventions that had greater effects on outcomes than appropriate placebo. Individual CBT also had a greater effect than psychodynamic psychotherapy (SMD -0{$\cdot$}56, 95\% CrI -1{$\cdot$}03 to -0{$\cdot$}11) and interpersonal psychotherapy, mindfulness, and supportive therapy (-0{$\cdot$}82, -1{$\cdot$}41 to -0{$\cdot$}24). Interpretation Individual CBT (which other studies have shown to have a lower risk of side-effects than pharmacotherapy) is associated with large effect sizes. Thus, it should be regarded as the best intervention for the initial treatment of social anxiety disorder. For individuals who decline psychological intervention, SSRIs show the most consistent evidence of benefit. Funding National Institute for Health and Care Excellence.},

Relative to the 1-tailed 95th-percentile critical effect size estimates, effectiveness of treatment provided in this setting was observed to be between 80\% (patients with comorbidity and without antidepressants) and 112\% (patients without comorbidity concurrently on antidepressants) as compared to the benchmarks.

The common mental health disorders covered here are depression, generalised anxiety disorder, panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder. The guideline is aimed at primary care practitioners, managers and commissioners.  The vast majority of depressive and anxiety disorders that are diagnosed are treated in primary care, but recognition of anxiety disorders, in particular, is poor. The focus of this guideline is to improve access to services and recognition of common mental health disorders in adults, and provide advice on the principles that need to be adopted to develop appropriate referral and local care pathways.   Although separate full NICEguidelines already exist for the management of most of these disorders, the importance and uniqueness of this book is in bringing together treatment and referral advice from the existing guidelines and combining it with new recommendations on access, identification, and developing care pathways. A new development method was formulated specifically for this guideline and this is explained.   All the evidence on which the recommendations were based, including the characteristics of studies, are on an accompanying CD-ROM.  NICE Mental Health Guidelines These guidelines from NICE set out clear recommendations, based on the best available evidence, for health care professionals on how to work with and implement physical, psychological and service-level interventions for people with various mental health conditions.},

Method: Patients (N = 370) in open-ended psychotherapy completed an extensive set of self-report measures and diagnostic interviews, including long-term follow-up in order to assess stability of outcomes. About half of the patients qualified for a personality disorder at the onset of treatment. Treatments were open-ended, and on average therapists provided substantially larger treatment doses than common in the literature. Results: A substantial majority recovered from their respective Axis I (58\%) and/or Axis II (55\%) disorders during treatment. Patients also experienced large positive changes in selfreport measures of overall psychiatric symptoms and moderate positive changes in selfreported interpersonal problems, while very few ({$<$} 3\%) demonstrated negative development. The patients maintained their diagnostic and self-assessed changes at a two-and-a-half-year follow-up. In contrast, self-reported occupational functioning showed minimal improvement throughout the treatment and follow-up phase. Conclusion: A naturalistic patient cohort undergoing open-ended psychotherapy demonstrates substantial and stable improvements.},

Moderator analyses revealed that higher pre-treatment severity of hypochondriasis/health anxiety was associated with greater effect sizes at follow-up visits and depression symptom severity was significantly associated with a lower in effect sizes at post-treatment. Although effect size did not vary as a function of blind assessment, smaller effect sizes were observed for CBT vs. treatment as usual control conditions than for CBT vs. waitlist control. A dose response relationship was also observed, such that a greater number of CBT sessions was associated with larger effect sizes at post-treatment. This review indicates that CBT is efficacious in the treatment of hypochondriasis/health anxiety and identifies potential moderators that are associated with outcome. The implications of these findings for further delineating prognostic and prescriptive indicators of CBT for hypochondriasis/health anxiety are discussed.},

Results indicated that CBT outperformed control conditions on primary outcome measures at post-treatment (Hedges's g = 1.39) and at follow-up (Hedges's g = 0.43). Subsequent analyses revealed few moderators of CBT efficacy. Neither higher pre-treatment OCD (p = 0.46) or depression symptom severity (p = 0.68) was significantly associated with a decrease in CBT effect size. Similarly, effect size did not vary as a function of `type' of CBT, treatment format, treatment integrity assessment, blind assessment, age of onset, duration of symptoms, percentage of females, number of sessions, or percent comorbidity. However, active treatments showed smaller effect sizes when compared to placebo controls than when compared to waitlist controls. Effect sizes were also smaller for adult RCTs than child RCTs. Likewise, older age was associated with smaller effect sizes. However, an association between age and effect size was not observed when examining child and adult samples separately. This review indicates that while CBT is efficacious in the treatment of OCD, more research is needed to identify processes that may predict more favorable treatment responses.

  abstract = {Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM) have contributed to improved clinical practice with increased use of effective and life-saving treatments for severe diseases. However, the EBM model is less suitable for psychotherapy research than for pharmacological research and somatic medicine. The randomized controlled trial (RCT) design is an example of experimental methodology, which inevitably has more imperfections in psychotherapy research because psychotherapy RCTs cannot use double-blinding and the treatments tested are composite treatment packages. Long-term psychotherapy for severe and complex mental disorders is especially difficult to study with an RCT design. During the last decades, advanced analytic methods have been developed in psychotherapy process research, which enables investigation of causal connections regarding change mechanisms in psychotherapy. Therefore, we propose that the top of the research evidence hierarchy for psychotherapy should encompass: (1) RCT for circumscribed disorders, (2) cohort studies for complex disorders, and (3) advanced process studies for change mechanisms.},

Knowledge of the course of untreated depression can serve as a benchmark for assessing the true benefits of active treatment. METHOD: A meta-analysis was performed analyzing the outcomes of all psychotherapy studies that randomized adult outpatients with major depressive disorder to a wait-list control group. RESULTS: Nineteen studies involving 221 subjects were reviewed. The mean decrease in Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression scores over 2-20 weeks was 11.9\%, while the mean decrease in Beck Depression Inventory scores was 15.7\%. Using a subsample of studies that reported individual outcomes, we estimated that 15 of 76 subjects (19.7\%) improved to a degree comparable to what would be considered a positive response in antidepressant trials. CONCLUSIONS: In the short-term, depressive symptomatology can be expected to decrease by about 10-15\% on average without treatment. As many as 20\% of subjects who participate in a short-term antidepressant trial may experience a spontaneous remission.},

  abstract = {Background: Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) is the front-line psychological intervention for step 3 within UK psychological therapy services. Counselling is recommended only when other interventions have failed and its effectiveness has been questioned. Method: A secondary data analysis was conducted of data collected from 33,243 patients across 103 Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) services as part of the second round of the National Audit of Psychological Therapies (NAPT). Initial analysis considered levels of pre-post therapy effect sizes (ESs) and reliable improvement (RI) and reliable and clinically significant improvement (RCSI). Multilevel modelling was used to model predictors of outcome, namely patient pre-post change on PHQ-9 scores at last therapy session. Results: Counselling received more referrals from patients experiencing moderate to severe depression than CBT. For patients scoring above the clinical cut-off on the PHQ-9 at intake, the pre-post ES (95\% CI) for CBT was 1.59 (1. 58, 1.62) with 46.6\% making RCSI criteria and for counselling the pre-post ES was 1.55 (1.52, 1.59) with 44.3\% of patients meeting RCSI criteria. Multilevel modelling revealed a significant site effect of 1.8\%, while therapy type was not a predictor of outcome. A significant interaction was found between the number of sessions attended and therapy type, with patients attending fewer sessions on average for counselling [M = 7.5 (5.54) sessions and a median (IQR) of 6 (3\textendash 10)] than CBT [M = 8.9 (6.34) sessions and a median (IQR) of 7 (4\textendash 12)]. Only where patients had 18 or 20 sessions was CBT significantly more effective than counselling, with recovery rates (95\% CIs) of 62.2\% (57.1, 66.9) and 62.4\% (56.5, 68.0) respectively, compared with 44.4\% (32.7, 56.6) and 42.6\% (30.0, 55.9) for counselling. Counselling was significantly more effective at two sessions with a recovery rate of 34.9\% (31.9, 37.9) compared with 22.2\% (20.5, 24.0) for CBT. Conclusions: Outcomes for counselling and CBT in the treatment of depression were comparable. Research efforts should focus on factors other than therapy type that may influence outcomes, namely the inherent variability between services, and adopt multilevel modelling as the given analytic approach in order to capture the naturally nested nature of the implementation and delivery of psychological therapies. It is of concern that half of all patients, regardless of type of intervention, did not show reliable improvement.},

However, the differential effectiveness of behavioral and cognitive approaches has shown inconclusive results. In this paper a meta-analysis on the effectiveness of psychological treatment for OCD is presented by applying random- and mixed-effects models. The literature search enabled us to identify 19 studies published between 1980 and 2006 that fulfilled our selection criteria, giving a total of 24 independent comparisons between a treated and a control group. The effect size index was the standardized mean difference in the posttest. The effect estimates for exposure with response prevention (ERP) alone (d+=1.127), cognitive restructuring (CR) alone (d+=1.090), and ERP plus CR (d+=0.998) were very similar, although the effect estimate for CR alone was based on only three comparisons. Therapist-guided exposure was better than therapist-assisted self-exposure, and exposure in vivo combined with exposure in imagination was better than exposure in vivo alone. The relationships of subject, methodological and extrinsic variables with effect size were also examined, and an analysis of publication bias was carried out. Finally, the implications of the results for clinical practice and for future research in this field were discussed.},

  abstract = {Although the efficacy of psychological treatment for panic disorder (PD) with or without agoraphobia has been the subject of a great deal of research, the specific contribution of techniques such as exposure, cognitive therapy, relaxation training and breathing retraining has not yet been clearly established. This paper presents a meta-analysis applying random- and mixed-effects models to a total of 65 comparisons between a treated and a control group, obtained from 42 studies published between 1980 and 2006. The results showed that, after controlling for the methodological quality of the studies and the type of control group, the combination of exposure, relaxation training, and breathing retraining gives the most consistent evidence for treating PD. Other factors that improve the effectiveness of treatments are the inclusion of homework during the intervention and a follow-up program after it has finished. Furthermore, the treatment is more effective when the patients have no comorbid disorders and the shorter the time they have been suffering from the illness. Publication bias and several methodological factors were discarded as a threat against the validity of our results. Finally the implications of the results for clinical practice and for future research are discussed.},

  abstract = {Homeless individuals experience higher rates of mental illness than the general population, though this group is less likely to receive evidence-based psychological treatment for these difficulties. One explanation for this science-to-service gap may be that most empirically supported interventions are designed to address a single disorder, which may not map on to the substantial comorbidity present in safety-net samples, and create a high training burden for often underresourced clinicians who must learn multiple protocols to address the needs of their patients. One solution may be to prioritize the dissemination of transdiagnostic interventions that can reduce therapist burden and simultaneously address comorbid conditions. The purpose of the present article is to describe the process of conducting a pilot study administering the Unified Protocol (UP), a transdiagnostic treatment for the range of emotional disorders, at a community-based organization that provides health care and other services to homeless individuals and families in Boston, Massachusetts. Therapists on a specialized behavioral health unit received didactic training in the intervention, followed by weekly consultation while they provided the UP to patients on their caseload. Qualitative and quantitative data were collected from both patients and therapists. Barriers to use of the UP by therapists, as well as to conducting research in this setting, will be discussed, along with the solutions that were used.

  abstract = {Consumer Reports (1995, November) published an article which concluded that patients benefitted very substantially from psychotherapy, that long-term treatment did considerably better than short-term treatment, and that psychotherapy alone did not differ in effectiveness from medication plus psychotherapy. Furthermore, no specific modality of psychotherapy did better than any other for any disorder; psychologists, psychiatrists, and social workers did not differ in their effectiveness as treaters; and all did better than marriage counselors and long-term family doctoring. Patients whose length of therapy or choice of therapist was limited by insurance or managed care did worse. The methodological virtues and drawbacks of this large-scale survey are examined and contrasted with the more traditional efficacy study, in which patients are randomized into a manualized, fixed duration treatment or into control groups. I conclude that the Consumer Reports survey complements the efficacy method, and that the best features of these two methods can be combined into a more ideal method that will best provide empirical validation of psychotherapy.

  abstract = {Psychotherapy meta-analyses sometimes generate heterogeneous results, partially due to key methodological characteristics which vary between studies (e.g., psychotherapy conditions are contrasted with structurally different control conditions). Examining these potential moderator variables can help explain heterogeneous results within and between psychotherapy meta-analyses. The present manuscript provides an overview of moderators that are highly relevant to test the generalizability of effects across psychotherapy trials. These moderators mainly fall into one of the following groups: (a) structural equivalence of interventions, (b) preferences/allegiances, (c) therapist effects, and (d) sample representativeness. Individual moderators include: Bona fide psychotherapy, proximity to psychological interventions, psychotherapy orientation, pre-training of therapists, supervision, caseload of therapists, dosage, homework, patient preferences, researcher and therapist allegiance, therapist effects in nested designs, aspects of sample representativeness, multiple outcomes, and time of assessment. Our analysis of 15 psychotherapy meta-analyses published in 2016 suggests that the structural equivalence of psychotherapeutic conditions, patient and therapist preferences/allegiances, therapist effects and nested data structures as well as sample representativeness were often neglected and little-discussed as potential moderators. The manuscript describes further conceptual and methodological challenges when conducting moderator analyses such as the categorization of psychological treatments and the importance of interrater coding. We encourage meta-analysts to consider moderators which have previously shown utility in explaining heterogeneous results in the psychotherapy literature.Clinical or methodological significance of this article: Relevant moderator variables help explain heterogeneous results in psychotherapy meta-analyses. Though these variables are often overlooked, they should be regularly incorporated in meta-analyses.},

The objective of this study was to develop a brief self-report scale to identify probable cases of GAD and evaluate its reliability and validity.A criterion-standard study was performed in 15 primary care clinics in the United States from November 2004 through June 2005. Of a total of 2740 adult patients completing a study questionnaire, 965 patients had a telephone interview with a mental health professional within 1 week. For criterion and construct validity, GAD self-report scale diagnoses were compared with independent diagnoses made by mental health professionals; functional status measures; disability days; and health care use.A 7-item anxiety scale (GAD-7) had good reliability, as well as criterion, construct, factorial, and procedural validity. A cut point was identified that optimized sensitivity (89\%) and specificity (82\%). Increasing scores on the scale were strongly associated with multiple domains of functional impairment (all 6 Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form General Health Survey scales and disability days). Although GAD and depression symptoms frequently co-occurred, factor analysis confirmed them as distinct dimensions. Moreover, GAD and depression symptoms had differing but independent effects on functional impairment and disability. There was good agreement between self-report and interviewer-administered versions of the scale.The GAD-7 is a valid and efficient tool for screening for GAD and assessing its severity in clinical practice and research.Arch Intern Med. 2006;166:1092-1097--{$>$}},

Meta-analytic effect sizes are presented for disorder-specific symptom measures as well as symptoms of generalized anxiety and depression for each disorder, and benchmarked to results from randomized controlled trials. All pretest\textendash posttest effect sizes for disorderspecific symptom measures were large, suggesting that CBT for adult anxiety disorders is effective in clinically representative conditions. Six studies included a control group, and between-groups comparisons yielded large effect sizes for disorder-specific symptoms in favor of CBT. Benchmarking indicated that results from effectiveness studies were in the range of those obtained in selected efficacy trials. To test whether studies that are more representative of clinical settings have smaller effect sizes, the authors coded studies for 9 criteria for clinical representativeness. Results indicate an inverse relationship between clinical representativeness and outcome, but the magnitude of the relationship is quite small.},

Limitations of conventional meta-analysis may be addressed using individual-participant-data (IPD). We aimed to determine a) whether results from IPD were consistent with study-level meta-analyses and b) whether demographic and clinical characteristics moderate treatment outcome.MethodsWe systematically searched PubMed, Embase, PsychInfo and CENTRAL. Authors of RCTs comparing CBTp with other psychological interventions were contacted to obtain original databases. Hierarchical mixed effects models were used to examine efficacy for psychotic symptoms. Patient characteristics were investigated as moderators of symptoms at post-treatment. Sensitivity analyses were conducted for risk of bias, treatment format and study characteristics.ResultsWe included 14 of 23 eligible RCTs in IPD meta-analyses including 898 patients. Ten RCTs minimised risk of bias. There was no significant difference in efficacy between RCTs providing IPD and those not (p {$>$}0.05). CBTp was superior vs. other interventions for total psychotic symptoms and PANSS general symptoms. No demographic or clinical characteristics were robustly demonstrated as moderators of positive, negative, general or total psychotic symptoms at post-treatment. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that number of sessions moderated the impact of treatment assignment (CBTp or other therapies) on total psychotic symptoms (p = 0.02).ConclusionsIPD suggest that patient characteristics, including severity of psychotic symptoms, do not significantly influence treatment outcome in psychological interventions for psychosis while investing in sufficient dosage of CBTp is important. IPD provide roughly equivalent efficacy estimates to study-level data although significant benefit was not replicated for positive symptoms. We encourage authors to ensure IPD is accessible for future research.},

  abstract = {Although dependence in effect sizes is ubiquitous, commonly used meta-analytic methods assume independent effect sizes. We describe and illustrate three-level extensions of a mixed effects meta-analytic model that accounts for various sources of dependence within and across studies, because multilevel extensions of metaanalytic models still are not well known. We also present a three-level model for the common case where, within studies, multiple effect sizes are calculated using the same sample. Whereas this approach is relatively simple and does not require imputing values for the unknown sampling covariances, it has hardly been used, and its performance has not been empirically investigated. Therefore, we set up a simulation study, showing that also in this situation, a threelevel approach yields valid results: Estimates of the treatment effects and the corresponding standard errors are unbiased.},

  abstract = {In meta-analysis, dependent effect sizes are very common. An example is where in one or more studies the effect of an intervention is evaluated on multiple outcome variables for the same sample of participants. In this paper, we evaluate a three-level meta-analytic model to account for this kind of dependence, extending the simulation results of Van den Noortgate, L\'opez-L\'opez, Mar\'in-Mart\'inez, and S\'anchez-Meca Behavior Research Methods, 45, 576\textendash 594 (2013) by allowing for a variation in the number of effect sizes per study, in the between-study variance, in the correlations between pairs of outcomes, and in the sample size of the studies. At the same time, we explore the performance of the approach if the outcomes used in a study can be regarded as a random sample from a population of outcomes. We conclude that although this approach is relatively simple and does not require prior estimates of the sampling covariances between effect sizes, it gives appropriate mean effect size estimates, standard error estimates, and confidence interval coverage proportions in a variety of realistic situations.},

The reasons that we fail to implement evidence-based psychotherapies are considered, including our personalities, knowledge, emotions, beliefs, behaviours and social milieus.

  abstract = {Background. Consistent evidence suggests that face-to-face Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) and Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT) may be equally effective depression treatments. Current clinical research focuses on detecting the best predictors-moderators of efficacy to guide treatment personalisation. However, individual moderator studies show inconsistent findings. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to compare the efficacy of CBT and IPT, including combined treatment with antidepressants for depression, and evaluate the predictive power of demographic, clinical presentation and treatment characteristics moderators for both therapies. Methods. PsycArticles, PsycINFO, PubMed and Cochrane Library were systematically searched through December 2017 for studies that have assessed individuals with major depression receiving either CBT or IPT in a face-to-face format both at pre- and post-treatment. Random-effects moderator meta-analyses were conducted. Results. One hundred and sixty-eight samples from 137 studies including 11374 participants qualified for the meta-analytic review. CBT and IPT were equally effective across all but one prespecified moderators. For psychotherapy delivered without concomitant antidepressant treatment (ADM's), CBT was superior to IPT (g=1.68, Qbetween p=0.037). Within-CBT moderator analyses showed that increased CBT efficacy was associated with lower age, high initial depression severity, individual format of administration and no adjunctive ADM's. Within-IPT analyses showed comparable efficacy across all moderators. Conclusions. Clinical guidance around combined treatment (psychotherapy plus ADM's) should be reconsidered. CBT alone is superior to IPT alone and to combined treatment, while IPT alone is non-inferior to combined treatment. More research is needed to assess the moderating effect of older age and number of previous episodes on IPT efficacy.},

  abstract = {Background:  Few studies have examined spontaneous remission from major depression. This study investigated the proportion of prevalent cases of untreated major depression that will remit without treatment in a year, and whether remission rates vary by disorder severity. Method: Wait-list controlled trials and observational cohort studies published up to 2010 with data describing remission from untreated depression at {$\leq$} 2-year follow-up were identified. Remission was defined as rescinded diagnoses or below threshold scores on standardized symptom measures. Nineteen studies were included in a regression model predicting the probability of 12-month remission from untreated depression, using logit transformed remission proportion as the dependent variable. Covariates included age, gender, study type and diagnostic measure. Results: Wait-listed compared to primary-care samples, studies with longer follow-up duration and older adult compared to adult samples were associated with lower probability of remission. Child and adolescent samples were associated with higher probability of remission. Based on adult samples recruited from primary-care settings, the model estimated that 23\% of prevalent cases of untreated depression will remit within 3 months, 32\% within 6 months and 53\% within 12 months. Conclusions: It is undesirable to expect 100\% treatment coverage for depression, given many will remit before access to services is feasible. Data were drawn from consenting wait-list and primary-care samples, which potentially over-represented mild-to-moderate cases of depression. Considering reported rates of spontaneous remission, a short untreated period seems defensible for this subpopulation, where judged appropriate by the clinician. Conclusions may not apply to individuals with more severe depression.}

As expected, exposure-based treatment produced large effects sizes relative to no treatment. They also outperformed placebo conditions and alternative active psychotherapeutic approaches. Treatments involving in vivo contact with the phobic target also outperformed alternative modes of exposure (e.g., imaginal exposure, virtual reality, etc.) at post-treatment but not at follow-up. Placebo treatments were significantly more effective than no treatment suggesting that specific phobia sufferers are moderately responsive to placebo interventions. Multi-session treatments marginally outperformed single-session treatments on domain-specific questionnaire measures of phobic dysfunction, and moderator analyses revealed that more sessions predicted more favorable outcomes. Contrary to expectation, effect sizes for the major comparisons of interest were not moderated by type of specific phobia. These findings provide the first quantitative summary evidence supporting the superiority of exposure-based treatments over alternative treatment approaches for those presenting with specific phobia.
